# The pillars and values of Scrum

> Scrum的支柱和价值

## Introduction: Scrum 101

> 简介：Scrum 101

Hi there, earlier we gave you an overview of the Agile mindset, which is based on the Agile Manifesto's four values and 12 principles.

We covered the Agile values, principles, and a set of Agile methodologies that we can use to manage projects in an Agile way.

> 我们涵盖了敏捷的价值、原则和一套敏捷方法，我们可以用敏捷的方式来管理项目。

Now, we're going to have a deep discussion about Scrum, the most commonly-used Agile framework.

> 现在，我们将深入讨论Scrum，这是最常用的敏捷框架。

The Scrum Guide, which contains everything you need to know about Scrum, is a main source of truth for Scrum Teams and is available for free at [Scrumguides.org](https://scrumguides.org/).

> Scrum 指南包含了你需要知道的关于 Scrum 的一切，它是 Scrum 团队的主要真理来源，可以在Scrumguides.org上免费获得。

We've also linked to it in the course resources.

I'll often refer back to what's said in the definitive-最好的,最权威的 Scrum Guide, so please bookmark-标记,标记 that site for future reference.

> 我将经常参考Scrum指南中权威性的内容，所以请将该网站收藏起来以备将来参考。

The majority of my Agile project management experience is in Scrum, and fortunately-幸运地 for me, Scrum is used a lot at Google. 

> 我的大部分敏捷项目管理经验都是在Scrum中进行的，幸运的是，Scrum在谷歌也被广泛使用。

Scrum is so prevalent-盛行的,普遍的 that people sometimes use the term Scrum and Agile interchangeably-可交换地.

> Scrum是如此流行，以至于人们有时会将Scrum和Agile这两个术语互换使用。

To make this really clear, Agile is the foundational philosophy-哲学 and mindset, while Scrum is a framework that materializes or brings that philosophy to life.

> 更明确地说，敏捷是基本的哲学和思维方式，而Scrum是一个框架，它将哲学具体化或带入生活。

In fact, Scrum came before the Agile Manifesto and served as an inspiration-灵感 for the entire Agile philosophy.

> 事实上，Scrum在敏捷宣言之前就已经出现了，它是整个敏捷哲学的灵感来源。

For the rest of this course, we'll focus on Scrum, which is the most popular project management framework.

We also mentioned other frameworks in the last module, which you're welcome to revisit any time, as needed.

> 我们还在上一个模块中提到了其他框架，欢迎您根据需要随时重新访问它们。

Ok, let's discuss Scrum.

We're going to start by exploring the theory behind Scrum, which has three pillars, and we'll explore the five Scrum values.

> 我们将从探索Scrum背后的理论开始，它有三个支柱，我们将探索Scrum的五个价值观。

I'll tell you why it's important for teams to have a set mission that they follow.

> 我会告诉你为什么团队有固定的任务是很重要的。

I'll also introduce the roles within a Scrum Team: the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team.

> 我还将介绍Scrum团队中的角色:产品负责人、Scrum Master和开发团队。

Lastly, I'm going to introduce all of these concepts to you using our new Office Green project.

> 最后，我将用我们新的绿色办公项目向大家介绍所有这些概念。

You probably remember Office Green as a company that handles plants and greenery for office buildings.

> 你可能记得Office Green是一家为办公大楼处理植物和绿化的公司。

Well, Office Green has a new project in the works called Virtual Verde, but we'll get into that later.

> 好吧，绿色办公室有一个新项目正在进行中，叫做“虚拟绿色”，但我们稍后再讨论。

You also learned that in Scrum projects, project managers typically take on the Scrum Master role.

> 您还了解到，在Scrum项目中，项目经理通常承担Scrum Master的角色。

So in this scenario, you'll be the Scrum Master, working with the Scrum Team, and you'll learn about Scrum artifacts, events, and what those entail.

> 所以在这种情况下，你将成为Scrum Master，与Scrum团队一起工作，你将学习Scrum工件、事件以及它们所带来的内容。

We're going to start with the three pillars of Scrum theory.

> 我们将从Scrum理论的三大支柱开始。

Meet you in the next video.



## The three pillars of Scrum

> Scrum 的三大支柱

Just as Agile has core values that teams must **adhere to**-遵守,坚持, Scrum has its own set of pillars that act as a foundation for Scrum Teams.

> 正如敏捷有团队必须坚持的核心价值一样，Scrum也有自己的一套支柱，作为Scrum团队的基础。

I'll go through the three pillars of Scrum in this video.

> 我将在这个视频中介绍Scrum的三大支柱。

---

Let's start by looking at the theory behind Scrum so that we could learn the various methods and understand why they're effective.

> 让我们从Scrum背后的理论开始，这样我们就可以学习各种方法，并理解它们为什么有效。

First, what is Scrum?

The Scrum Guide defines Scrum as a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining-维持,保持 complex products.

> Scrum指南将Scrum定义为开发、交付和维护复杂产品的框架。

That means a team can use Scrum to create valuable products for their users, even when the environment or industry they're in is hard to predict and there are many risks.

> 这意味着团队可以使用Scrum为他们的用户创造有价值的产品，即使他们所处的环境或行业很难预测，并且存在许多风险。

Scrum uses an iterative and incremental approach.

> Scrum使用迭代和增量的方法。

Iterative refers to the fact that project processes are repeated.

> 迭代是指项目过程是重复的这一事实。

We discussed this a bit in the last module, but as a reminder, iterative means that the project works in time boxes or iterations. 

> 我们在上一个模块中讨论了一点，但是提醒一下，迭代意味着项目在时间框或迭代中工作。

Incremental refers to the work being divided into smaller chunks that build on each other.

> 增量指的是将工作分成更小的块，这些块相互构建。

The product is built over time through work done during each iteration.

> 产品是随着时间的推移，通过每次迭代期间完成的工作来构建的。

Each of these instances of the product is called an increment.

> 这些产品的每个实例都称为增量。

Iterations and increments allow us to keep checking in on our progress throughout the life cycle of the project.

> 迭代和增量使我们能够在项目的整个生命周期中不断检查我们的进度。

This helps us become-变得,成为,适合 more predictable and manage the uncertainty in our project.

> 这有助于我们变得更可预测，并管理项目中的不确定性。

Scrum is founded on a scientific-科学的 theory called empiricism-经验主义,经验论.

> Scrum 建立在一种叫做经验主义的科学理论之上。

This is a fancy-华丽的 word for a simple concept: that true knowledge comes from actual, lived experience.

> 这是一个简单概念的华丽词汇:真正的知识来自于实际的生活经验。

The Scrum founders-创立者 emphasize that we shouldn't try to assume that things will go exactly as planned or try to predict the future in an uncertain world.

> Scrum创始人强调，我们不应该试图假设事情会完全按计划进行，或者试图在不确定的世界中预测未来。

Instead, if you're using Scrum, you're ensuring that each decision you make in your project is based on real experience and hard-确凿的,可靠的 data.

> 相反，如果你使用Scrum，你要确保你在项目中做出的每一个决定都是基于真实的经验和确凿的数据。

So each iteration and increment is understood as a mini-experiment where we can learn really valuable things to help improve the project.

> 因此，每次迭代和增量都被理解为一个小型实验，我们可以从中学到真正有价值的东西，以帮助改进项目。

---

Empiricism-经验主义,经验论 is built on three foundational pillars.

> 经验主义建立在三个基本支柱上。

Those pillars are transparency-透明,清晰度, inspection-检查,审视, and adaptation-适应, and they're also the three pillars of Scrum.

> 这些支柱是透明度、检查和适应，它们也是Scrum的三大支柱。

First, there's transparency.

> 首先是透明度。

Transparency means that we make the most significant aspects of our work visible to those responsible for the outcome. 

> 透明度意味着我们让那些对结果负责的人看到我们工作中最重要的方面。

Everyone must be transparent.

This includes everyone from Scrum Team members to senior sponsors, and even our users.

> 这包括从Scrum团队成员到高级发起人，甚至是我们的用户。

It's easier to be transparent with a small team.

> 小团队更容易做到透明。

And luckily, Scrum Teams are deliberately-故意地 small—ranging between three and nine people.

> 幸运的是，Scrum团队的规模很小，只有3到9个人。

This way, you avoid mixed signals, breakdowns of communication, and unnecessary complications-并发症,复杂化.

> 这样，您就可以避免信号混淆、沟通中断和不必要的并发症。

Transparency inside a Scrum Team is critical to the team's productivity and the project's completion.

> Scrum 团队内部的透明度对团队的生产力和项目的完成至关重要。

In terms of transparency outside of the team, being transparent with all stakeholders, including customers, sponsors, and management builds a level of trust between everyone involved.

> 就团队外部的透明度而言，对所有利益相关者(包括客户、赞助商和管理层)保持透明，可以在每个参与者之间建立一定程度的信任。

Transparency also encourages more collaboration and fewer mistakes.

> 透明度也鼓励更多的合作和更少的错误。

---

The second pillar of Scrum is inspection.

> Scrum的第二个支柱是检查。

Inspection refers to conducting timely checks towards the outcome of a Sprint goal to detect-识别 undesirable-不想要的 variances-差异,分歧,不一致.

> 检查指的是对Sprint目标的结果进行及时检查，以检测不希望出现的差异。

This means that we're always checking in on our progress and deliverables so that we can detect any undesirable changes.

> 这意味着我们总是检查我们的进度和可交付成果，这样我们就可以发现任何不希望看到的变化。

When teams work in an Agile way, a stakeholder review of their work is a necessary opportunity for growth and progress.

> 当团队以敏捷方式工作时，涉众对他们工作的回顾是成长和进步的必要机会。

The more inspections that take place, the more improvement a team experiences in their work.

> 进行的检查越多，团队在工作中经历的改进就越多。

There's real value to be gained from deliberate-深思熟虑的,故意的,蓄意的 inspection while you have a chance to change and improve.

> 当你有机会改变和提高时，你可以从深思熟虑的检查中获得真正的价值。

---

Inspection also propels-推进,驱动 our next pillar: adaptation.

> 检查也推动了我们的下一个支柱:适应。

Adaptation means that we're continuously searching for ways to adjust our project, product, or processes to minimize any further deviation-偏差 or issues.

> 适应意味着我们不断地寻找方法来调整我们的项目、产品或过程，以最小化任何进一步的偏差或问题。

In Scrum, and in Agile as a whole, for that matter, we embrace change so that we are always improving.

> 在Scrum中，在整个敏捷中，我们拥抱变化，这样我们就总是在改进。

So when we adapt, we change aspects that do not work or could be better.

> 因此，当我们适应时，我们会改变那些不起作用或可以做得更好的方面。

Transparency and inspection gives Scrum Teams the information and opportunity they need to identify improvements or changes.

> 透明度和检查为Scrum团队提供了识别改进或变更所需的信息和机会。

Although adaptation includes immediate fixes to problems, it may also be about implementing a change so future projects don't repeat past mistakes.

> 虽然适应包括对问题的即时修复，但它也可能是关于实施改变，以便未来的项目不会重复过去的错误。

---

Now you know the three pillars that act as a foundation to Scrum: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

In the next video, we'll visit the five values that all Scrum teams adhere to.

Meet you there.



## The five values of Scrum

> Scrum的五个价值

Hello again.

In the previous video, we discussed Scrum theory and explored the three pillars of Scrum.

> 在之前的视频中，我们讨论了Scrum理论，并探讨了Scrum的三大支柱。

In this video, we're going to talk about the five values of Scrum and how they relate to the three pillars.

> 在本视频中，我们将讨论Scrum的五个价值观，以及它们与三大支柱之间的关系。

Having a value system as a team is great because you'll expect-期待,期望 each other to act in a way that is aligned with these values.

> 作为一个团队，拥有一个价值体系是很好的，因为你会期望彼此以与这些价值观一致的方式行事。

So let's get into it.

> 让我们开始吧。

---

Scrum Teams work and behave according to five core values: commitment-承诺,保证, courage-勇气,胆量, focus, openness-开放, and respect-尊重.

> Scrum团队的工作和行为遵循五个核心价值观：承诺、勇气、专注、开放和尊重。

First, there's commitment.

> 首先是承诺。

This means personally committing to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.

> 这意味着个人承诺实现Scrum团队的目标。

For example, maybe a member of the team is struggling to overcome-克服,解决 something that is blocking their work from getting done, like a new technology that is proving-证明,检验 difficult to learn.

> 例如，也许团队中的一个成员正在努力克服一些阻碍他们完成工作的事情，比如一项新技术很难学习。

In this case, another team member who is familiar with the technology can put their own work aside to step in and help their teammate learn the technology.

> 在这种情况下，熟悉技术的另一个团队成员可以把自己的工作放在一边，帮助他们的队友学习技术。

---

The second value is courage.

> 第二个价值是勇气。

Scrum Team members must have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough-棘手的,艰难的 problems.

> Scrum 团队成员必须有勇气做正确的事情，解决棘手的问题。

In any project, there's **a body of**-大量 work that needs to get done.

> 在任何项目中，都有大量的工作需要完成。

Some of the work will be relatively-相当地,相对地 simple, and some will be complex with many risks.

> 有些工作将相对简单，有些工作将复杂，有许多风险。

An example of courage includes taking on a hard-艰难的,确凿的,可靠的 task that you know will require you to learn a new skill.

> 勇气的一个例子包括承担一项艰巨的任务，你知道这需要你学习一项新技能。

Courage could mean telling your team that you're stuck-被困住 and you need help.

> 勇气意味着告诉你的团队你被困住了，你需要帮助。

It might also mean calling out a negative-消极的,悲观的 behavior within the team to openly discuss and address the behavior.

> 这也可能意味着在团队中公开讨论和解决消极行为。

Demonstrating courage when responding to challenging situations can strengthen-巩固,加强 the team's resilience-恢复力,弹性.

> 在应对具有挑战性的情况时表现出勇气可以增强团队的应变能力。

---

Third, there's focus.

> 第三，专注。

This refers to everyone focusing on the necessary work within the Sprint and the overall goals of the Scrum Team.

> 这指的是每个人都专注于Sprint中必要的工作和Scrum团队的总体目标。

For example, a team member is working on a solution that involves a new technology and is very difficult.

> 例如，一个团队成员正在研究一个涉及新技术的解决方案，并且非常困难。

Allowing that team member to focus on that difficult yet necessary part of the solution is key, and their teammates help get it across the finish line.

> 让团队成员专注于解决方案中困难但必要的部分是关键，他们的队友会帮助他们跨过终点线。

They know that focusing on the solution will **speed up**-加速,增加速度 the team's progress in the long run, so it's worth the investment now.

> 他们知道，从长远来看，专注于解决方案将加速团队的进步，因此现在的投资是值得的。

The Scrum Master, a role often assumed by the project manager, helps the team to focus on the Sprint and product goals by facilitating their activities and events on a daily basis.

> Scrum Master 这个角色通常由项目经理担任，通过促进团队每天的活动和事件，帮助团队专注于Sprint和产品目标。

---

The fourth value is openness.

> 第四个价值观是开放。

For Scrum to work, the team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the various challenges that come with performing the work.

> 为了让 Scrum 发挥作用，团队及其利益相关者同意公开所有的工作以及执行工作时遇到的各种挑战。

Openness is essential to a productive-富有成效的,多产的 Scrum Team.

> 开放对于高效的Scrum团队来说是必不可少的。

In order to gather data, team members must be willing to share their observations-观察,观察资料,观察结果 and experiences.

> 为了收集数据，团队成员必须愿意分享他们的观察和经验。

If a team member runs into an issue within the project that they aren't sure how to fix, they should share it with the team. 

> 如果团队成员在项目中遇到他们不确定如何解决的问题，他们应该与团队分享。

Another team member may have a very quick and easy solution, or at least valuable insight into some options on how to handle their issue.

> 另一个团队成员可能有一个非常快速和简单的解决方案，或者至少对如何处理他们的问题有一些有价值的见解。

---

The fifth and final Scrum pillar is respect.

> 第五个也是最后一个Scrum支柱是尊重。

Team members should respect the opinions, skills, and independence-独立性 of their teammates.

> 团队成员应该尊重队友的意见、技能和独立性。

When you respect the independence and contributions of others and feel respected yourself, you're more likely to listen and hear any feedback.

> 当你尊重他人的独立性和贡献，并感到自己受到尊重时，你更有可能倾听和听到任何反馈。

This is crucial-至关重要的,关键的 in making the product or business as successful as possible.

> 这是使产品或业务尽可能成功的关键。

---

In order for a team to bring the three pillars of Scrum to life, they must act **in accordance with**-按照,依据,与...一致 the five Scrum values.

> 为了让团队将Scrum的三大支柱变为现实，他们必须按照Scrum的五个价值观行事。

For example, if a team aims to achieve transparency between themselves and their stakeholders, they need to be open to sharing information while still having the focus to share **the most**-最... relevant information.

> 例如，如果一个团队的目标是在他们自己和他们的利益相关者之间实现透明，他们需要开放地共享信息，同时仍然关注共享最相关的信息。

For a team to effectively inspect-检查,审视 their work and their processes, they must have courage to offer difficult feedback, and have the mutual-相互的,彼此的 respect to really listen to what others have to say.

> 对于一个团队来说，要有效地检查他们的工作和过程，他们必须有勇气提供困难的反馈，并相互尊重，真正倾听他人的意见。

For a team to adapt to their inspection results, they must have the courage to make changes and learn from them.

> 对于一个团队来说，要适应他们的检查结果，他们必须有勇气做出改变并从中学习。

They must also be committed to the goals of the team and follow through on the adaptation.

> 他们还必须致力于团队的目标，并在适应过程中坚持到底。

---

Amazing.

We've now covered the foundational pillars and values behind a Scrum Team.

> 我们现在已经介绍了Scrum团队背后的基本支柱和价值观。

We've also covered how the team supports Scrum values as they relate to Agile.

> 我们还讨论了团队如何支持Scrum价值观，因为它们与敏捷相关。

Meet me in the next video, where we'll discuss specific Scrum roles on a team.

> 下个视频见，我们将讨论团队中具体的Scrum角色。



## The Scrum Guide

> Scrum 指南

In the last video, you learned that the Scrum Guide acts as the main source of truth for Scrum teams and contains everything you need to know about Scrum.

> 在上一个视频中，您了解到 Scrum 指南是 Scrum 团队的主要事实来源，包含了您需要了解的关于 Scrum 的所有内容。

You also learned that Scrum is a framework within the foundational project management philosophy called Agile.

> 您还了解到 Scrum 是基础项目管理哲学敏捷中的一个框架。

The Scrum Guide defines Scrum as “A framework within which people can address complex adaptive-适配,适应性 problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.”

> Scrum指南将Scrum定义为“一个框架，在这个框架中，人们可以解决复杂的适应性问题，同时高效地、创造性地交付尽可能高价值的产品。”

This reading will review the Scrum pillars and values and then provide links to the Scrum Guide and further reading about Scrum. 

> 本文将回顾Scrum的支柱和价值，然后提供Scrum指南的链接以及关于Scrum的进一步阅读。

**Pillars and values** 

To recap, every person on a Scrum team subscribes-赞成,同意 to the three pillars and the five values of Scrum. 

> 总结一下，Scrum团队中的每个人都认同Scrum的三大支柱和五大价值观。

**The three pillars of Scrum are:** 

- Transparency：透明性
- Inspection：检查
- Adaptation ：适应

**The five values of Scrum are:** 

- Courage：勇气
- Commitment：承诺,保证
- Focus：专注
- Openness：开放性
- Respect：尊重

In order for a team to succeed, it is incredibly-难以置信的,非常地 important that every team member follow these core pillars and values.

> 为了让一个团队取得成功，每个团队成员都遵循这些核心支柱和价值观是非常重要的。

Scrum only has a few rules and practices that are easy to follow.

> Scrum只有一些易于遵循的规则和实践。

It is also easy to understand.

However, Scrum can be challenging to master because mastery-精通,熟练掌握 depends on being able to embody-具体表现,体现, live, and promote the pillars and values of Scrum. 

> 然而，掌握Scrum是具有挑战性的，因为掌握Scrum取决于能够体现、实践和推广Scrum的支柱和价值观。

# Scrum roles and responsibilities

> Scrum角色和职责

## Essential Scrum roles

> Scrum的基本角色

Hello again.

Now that we've covered the theory behind Scrum, the next few videos will focus on the three Scrum roles that make up the Scrum Team, their respective-分别的,各自的 traits-特征,特点, and the Scrum Team's mission.

> 现在我们已经介绍了 Scrum 背后的理论，接下来的几个视频将重点介绍组成 Scrum 团队的三个 Scrum 角色，他们各自的特点，以及Scrum团队的使命。

If you think of a team in the context of a team sport like soccer-足球 in the United States, or football for our global learners, each position plays a certain role.

> 如果你在团队运动的背景下考虑一个团队，比如美国的足球，或者我们全球学习者的足球，每个位置都扮演着一定的角色。

You have strikers-前锋, wingers-边锋, defenders-后卫, goalkeepers-守门员, and more.

> 你有前锋、边锋、后卫、守门员等等。

Each player has their own responsibilities they must fulfill in order to try to win the game.

> 为了赢得比赛，每个球员都有自己必须履行的责任。

The same is true for Scrum Teams.

> Scrum团队也是如此。

And just like our Scrum name inspiration-灵感, the sport of rugby, the team is working towards a specific objective to win.

> 就像我们的Scrum名字的灵感，橄榄球运动，团队朝着一个特定的目标努力，赢得胜利。

Let's start by discussing the team's product vision and mission.

> 让我们从讨论团队的产品愿景和使命开始。

Remember, Scrum is an Agile methodology, so it embodies-具体表现,体现 the values and principles of Agile.

> 记住，Scrum是一种敏捷方法，所以它体现了敏捷的价值和原则。

---

One of the Agile principles states: Build projects around motivated individuals.

> 敏捷原则之一是:围绕被激励的个人构建项目。

Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

> 给他们所需的环境和支持，相信他们能完成工作。

The best way to motivate individuals is to give them a mission and product vision that they really care about, so they can feel good about working towards it.

> 激励员工的最好方法是给他们一个他们真正关心的使命和产品愿景，这样他们就会对朝着这个目标努力感到高兴。

In Agile, a mission is a short statement that stays constant-持续不断的,经常发生的 for your team throughout the process and gives them something to work toward.

> 在敏捷中，使命是一个简短的陈述，在整个过程中对团队保持不变，并给他们一些努力的方向。

**In addition to**-除了…之外 the mission, an Agile team will also set a product vision making it clear what outcomes the team is responsible for and where your team's boundaries are.

> 除了使命之外，敏捷团队还会设定一个产品愿景，明确团队负责的结果以及团队的界限在哪里。

This may sound a bit like management speak, but I like to think about it this way: A mission tells me why we're doing the work.

> 这听起来可能有点像管理用语，但我喜欢这样思考：使命告诉我我们为什么要做这项工作。

A product vision helps me imagine what the work will be like when we're done.

> 产品愿景帮助我想象工作完成后会是什么样子。

Let's think about the mission and product vision with Office Green's new Virtual Verde project.

> 让我们考虑一下Office Green的新Virtual Verde项目的使命和产品愿景。

Virtual Verde delivers plants to people's home offices.

> Virtual Verde将植物送到人们的家庭办公室。

Office Green's Business Development Department came up with a mission for the project.

> 格林办公室的业务发展部为这个项目提出了一个任务。

Virtual Verde improves users' health and happiness by bringing their at-home workspace to life.

> Virtual Verde通过将家庭工作空间带入生活，改善用户的健康和快乐。

A product vision created by the Scrum Team might be, Virtual Verde is a living marketplace that transforms the home office.

> Scrum团队创建的产品愿景可能是，Virtual Verde是一个改变家庭办公室的生活市场。

These two statements are meant to inspire-激励 the team to deliver a delightful-令人愉快的,宜人的 experience for Virtual Verde's users.

> 这两句话旨在激励团队为Virtual Verde的用户提供愉快的体验。

---

Now let's discuss Scrum Team roles.

> 现在让我们讨论一下Scrum团队的角色。

Every Scrum Team consists of three defined roles: a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, and the Development Team.

> 每个Scrum团队由三个定义好的角色组成:Scrum Master, Product Owner和Development Team。

These roles work together to achieve the team's objectives and realize the mission and vision.

> 这些角色一起工作以实现团队的目标，并实现任务和愿景。

The Product Owner is responsible for what a team builds.

> 产品负责人负责团队构建的内容。

They also must ensure everyone understands the why.

> 他们还必须确保每个人都明白其中的原因。

For example, the Virtual Verde team needs a Product Owner to capture and promote the great ideas coming from the team about the new service, which is delivering plants to people who work from home.

> 例如，Virtual Verde团队需要一名产品负责人来捕捉和推广来自团队的关于新服务的伟大想法，该服务是向在家工作的人提供植物。

The Product Owner's job is to build the right thing.

> 产品负责人的工作是构建正确的东西。

---

The Development Team is responsible for how a team will deliver that product.

> 开发团队负责团队将如何交付该产品。

For example, creating a new website is next on our to-do list so customers can order plants for the home office.

> 例如，创建一个新网站是我们的下一项任务，这样客户就可以为家庭办公室订购植物。

The Development Team is building websites, integrating billing systems, and fixing issues.

> 开发团队正在构建网站，集成计费系统，并解决问题。

The Development Team's job is to build the thing right.

> 开发团队的工作是构建正确的东西。

---

The Scrum Master is responsible for when a team will deliver value to its users.

> Scrum Master负责团队何时向用户交付价值。

This role is roughly-粗略地,大约 equivalent-等同的,等效的 to the project manager role in traditional projects.

> 这个角色大致相当于传统项目中的项目经理角色。

The Virtual Verde Scrum Master is helping unblock the team from getting things done, such as finding out why a vendor was late or helping the team prioritize issues from users or organizing the demo for the CEO.

> Virtual Verde Scrum Master可以帮助团队解决问题，比如找出供应商迟到的原因，或者帮助团队优先考虑用户的问题，或者为CEO组织演示。

The Scrum Master's job is to build the thing fast.

> Scrum管理员的工作是快速构建产品。

---

Although there are clearly defined roles on a Scrum Team, it's important to note that the entire team works together to achieve its goals.

> 尽管Scrum团队中有明确定义的角色，但重要的是要注意整个团队一起工作以实现其目标。

In other words, although there are specific expectations-期待,期望 for each role, the Development Team may still contribute ideas for the "what' and the "when" of a project, while the Product Owner may contribute to discussions on the "how" of the project.

> 换句话说，尽管每个角色都有特定的期望，开发团队仍然可以为项目的“什么”和“什么时候”提供想法，而产品负责人可以为项目的“如何”进行讨论做出贡献。

As a collective, Scrum Teams must exhibit-展出 a few specific skills.

> 作为一个集体，Scrum团队必须展示一些特定的技能。

The Scrum Guide details these skills as follows.

> Scrum 指南将这些技能详细介绍如下。

Scrum Teams are cross-functional.

> Scrum团队是跨职能的。

When a Scrum Team delivers something, it's the accomplishment of the entire team, no matter what function or organization they're in.

> 当Scrum团队交付了某些东西时，这是整个团队的成就，无论他们在哪个职能部门或组织中。

On your Scrum Team, you may have a software developer, a marketing specialist-专家, a quality assurance, and logistics-物流 expert.

> 在你的Scrum团队中，你可能有一个软件开发人员、一个营销专家、一个质量保证专家和一个物流专家。

You may remember our soccer-英式足球 team analogy-类比,进行比照, when each player comes together to play their position, the end result is you have all you need to get the ball into the goal.

> 你可能还记得我们的足球队的比喻，当每个球员都在各自的位置上，最终的结果是你有了所有你需要的东西来把球打进球门。

Plus, these fresh-新的,新颖的 perspectives add a lot of value to your project and to your users and business.

> 此外，这些新的视角为您的项目、用户和业务增加了很多价值。

---

Scrum Teams are self-organizing.

> Scrum团队是自组织的。

This may sound radically-根本上,彻底地 different from other organizations you've worked at before, where your managers dictate your tasks and request frequent updates.

> 这听起来可能与你以前工作过的其他公司截然不同，在那些公司里，你的经理会规定你的任务，并要求你经常更新。

But because Scrum Teams rely on those five values—commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect—the Scrum Team is able to work together to deliver amazing results in a more organic and flexible-灵活的 environment.

> 但是，由于Scrum团队依赖于这五种价值观——承诺、勇气、专注、开放和尊重——Scrum团队能够在一个更有机、更灵活的环境中共同努力，交付惊人的结果。

Although teams are self-organizing, high-performing Scrum Teams often have a manager who sits outside of the Scrum Team and provides strategic leadership and individual career development without disrupting the self-organizing nature of Scrum.

> 虽然团队是自组织的，但高绩效的Scrum团队通常有一个经理，他在Scrum团队之外提供战略领导和个人职业发展，而不会破坏Scrum的自组织特性。

In my experience, if a manager feels compelled-强迫,迫使,促使 to start telling the team what to do and interferes-阻碍,妨害 with the self-organizing nature, the benefits of Scrum will begin to collapse-倒塌,塌陷.

> 根据我的经验，如果一个经理觉得必须开始告诉团队该做什么，并且干扰了自组织的本质，那么Scrum的好处就会开始瓦解。

Now that you have a better understanding of what constitutes-组成,构成 a Scrum Team, we'll take you through the specifics of each role in the next few videos.

> 现在你对Scrum团队的组成有了更好的理解，我们将在接下来的几个视频中带你了解每个角色的具体内容。

We'll start with the traits-特征,特点 of an effective Scrum Master.

> 我们将从一个有效的Scrum Master的特征开始。



## Traits-特征,特点 of an effective Scrum Master

> 一个有效的Scrum管理员的特征

Welcome back.

We've already mentioned that in Scrum, the project manager is most likely playing the role of Scrum Master.

> 我们已经提到过，在Scrum中，项目经理最有可能扮演Scrum Master的角色。

So what exactly-究竟,到底 does a Scrum Master role entail?

> 那么Scrum Master角色到底需要做些什么呢?

In this video, I'll further define what a Scrum Master is.

Then I'll explain some of the differences and similarities between a Scrum Master and a project manager.

The Scrum Master promotes and supports the Scrum process by helping everyone understand and implement Scrum.

> Scrum Master通过帮助每个人理解和实施Scrum来促进和支持Scrum过程。

This includes its practices, rules, and values.

> 这包括它的实践、规则和价值观。

My favorite way to describe the role of a Scrum Master is that they're responsible for helping the team be their very best.

> 我最喜欢的描述Scrum Master角色的方式是，他们负责帮助团队做到最好。

They can achieve this by coaching-训练,指导 individuals on the team to manage external forces-力,力量, as well as maximizing the team's internal potential-潜能,潜力.

> 他们可以通过指导团队中的个人来管理外部力量，以及最大化团队的内部潜力来实现这一点。

For example, let's say that Virtual Verde keeps getting error reports about the shopping cart-购物车 feature on their new website page. 

> 例如，假设Virtual Verde在其新网站页面上不断收到关于购物车功能的错误报告。

The Scrum Master is there to notice the pattern and help the team find a better solution, rather than just fixing one error at a time.

> Scrum Master的作用是发现模式并帮助团队找到更好的解决方案，而不是一次只修复一个错误。

Maybe a special test plan is needed or extra solution reviews for that feature are needed before changes are released.

> 可能需要一个特殊的测试计划，或者在发布更改之前需要对该特性进行额外的解决方案审查。

The Scrum Master's responsibilities include coaching team members on the Agile and Scrum practices, rules, and values and helping to find ways to manage the Product Backlog effectively.

> Scrum Master的职责包括指导团队成员学习敏捷和Scrum实践、规则和价值观，并帮助找到有效管理产品待办事项列表的方法。

The Product Backlog is the single authoritative source for things that a team works on.

> 产品待办事项列表是团队工作的唯一权威来源。

It contains all of the product features, product requirements, and activities associated with deliverables to achieve the goal of the project.

> 它包含所有的产品特性、产品需求，以及与实现项目目标的可交付成果相关的活动。

The Scrum Master facilitates Scrum events such as Sprint Retrospectives, which happen at the end of every Sprint.

> Scrum Master促进Scrum活动，例如在每个Sprint结束时进行的Sprint回顾。

The Scrum Master helps the team remove any blockers to their progress, such as missing information or access to training or tools.

> Scrum Master可以帮助团队消除任何阻碍他们前进的障碍，比如缺少信息或缺少培训或工具。

The Scrum Master also prevents-防止,预防 unhelpful interactions or interruptions-中断,干扰 coming from outside of the team.

> Scrum Master还可以防止来自团队外部的无益的交互或干扰。

At this point, you may be wondering-想知道,好奇, how am I going to do all of that?

> 在这一点上，你可能想知道，我要怎么做所有这些?

Well, you probably already have many of the traits that Scrum Masters need to execute these tasks.

> 好吧，你可能已经具备了Scrum master执行这些任务所需的许多特征。

A Scrum Master is required to be organized and supportive as they lead.

> Scrum Master在领导时需要有组织和支持。

They're also facilitators, coaches, and great communicators.

> 他们也是促进者、教练和伟大的沟通者。

Let's find out how these traits are helpful in a Scrum Master's role.

> 让我们来看看这些特征对Scrum Master的角色有什么帮助。

---

Scrum Masters must have good organizational skills that help them to effectively organize project artifacts and manage Scrum events.

> Scrum master必须具备良好的组织技能，帮助他们有效地组织项目工件和管理Scrum事件。

Scrum Masters must be supportive-支持性 leaders who focus on the needs of others and the needs of the team before their individual needs.

> Scrum master必须是一个支持性的领导者，他关注他人和团队的需求，而不是个人的需求。

They're not aiming to raise themselves up as a manager of the team who bosses people around; rather, they're always asking questions like "How can I help?" or "What would help the team go forward-促进,推进 on this project?"

> 他们的目标不是把自己提升为团队的管理者，对周围的人发号施令;相反，他们总是问这样的问题:“我能帮什么忙?”或“什么能帮助团队推进这个项目?”

Scrum Masters facilitate productivity and collaboration.

> Scrum Masters 促进了生产力和协作。

This is a critical skill to ensuring every team member's voice is heard and that their input is addressed.

> 这是一项关键技能，可以确保每个团队成员的声音都能被听到，他们的输入都能得到处理。

Scrum Masters must coach team members on Scrum theory and application.

> Scrum master必须指导团队成员学习Scrum理论和应用。

Coaching is a skill that encourages dialogue-对话 and discussion over simply giving the answers directly.

> 指导是一种鼓励对话和讨论的技能，而不是简单地直接给出答案。

Finally, Scrum Masters must be great communicators, particularly when it comes to stakeholders.

> 最后，Scrum master必须是优秀的沟通者，尤其是在涉及涉众的时候。

Scrum Masters are experienced in engaging with diverse-不同的,各式各样的 stakeholders who may have competing-竞争 perspectives and styles.

> Scrum master在与不同的干系人打交道方面经验丰富，这些干系人可能有不同的观点和风格。

A Scrum Master who can relate to many different types of people is a powerful-强大的,有影响力的 and essential teammate to have on a project.

> 一个能够与许多不同类型的人打交道的Scrum Master是一个强大的、必不可少的项目团队成员。

---

You're probably wondering if the role of a Scrum Master differs from a traditional project manager.

> 你可能想知道Scrum Master的角色是否与传统的项目经理不同。

The answer is yes, the two roles can be quite different, although they may be played by the same individual and require a similar skill set.

> 答案是肯定的，这两个角色可能完全不同，尽管它们可能由同一个人扮演，并且需要相似的技能。

As their primary responsibility, the Scrum Master acts as a facilitator and a coach to the Scrum Team, and they need to make sure that they have enough time in the day to do this job first and foremost-最基础地.

> Scrum Master 的主要职责是充当Scrum团队的推动者和教练，他们需要确保每天有足够的时间来完成这项工作。

If the company requires the management of many additional project management activities, then the team might hire project managers who own that more traditional project management-oriented work.

> 如果公司需要管理许多额外的项目管理活动，那么团队可能会雇用拥有更传统的面向项目管理的工作的项目经理。

That work may include things like budget management, risks spreadsheets, or Gantt charts.

> 这项工作可能包括预算管理、风险电子表格或甘特图。

But as I've said, it's common for traditional project managers to take on the role of a Scrum Master.

> 但是正如我所说的，传统的项目经理承担Scrum Master的角色是很常见的。

They rely heavily on things like decision making, communicating flexibility, organizational skills, and more, and the position of Scrum Master is a natural fit for many of us as project managers.

> 他们在很大程度上依赖于决策制定、沟通灵活性、组织技能等等，Scrum Master这个职位对我们很多人来说都是一个自然的项目经理。

Now you know a bit more about the pillars and the role of the Scrum Master.

> 现在你对Scrum Master的支柱和角色有了更多的了解。

---

To recap, a Scrum Master must possess skills like organization, leadership, the ability to facilitate, coach, and manage stakeholders.

> 总而言之，Scrum Master必须具备组织、领导、促进、指导和管理干系人的能力。

And a Scrum Master can be quite different from a project manager in terms of their responsibilities, but the role may be played by the same individual since they require a similar skill set.

> 就职责而言，Scrum Master和项目经理可能会有很大的不同，但由于他们需要相似的技能集，这个角色可能由同一个人扮演。

In the next video, we'll learn what a Product Owner does.

> 在下一个视频中，我们将学习产品负责人是做什么的。

Meet you there.



## Pete: What makes an effective Scrum Master

> Pete:是什么造就了一个高效的Scrum Master

Hi, my name is Pete, and I work as a Technical Program Manager in Google.

The responsibility of the Technical Program Manager is to see the end-to-end-端到端 execution of the programs for which they are responsible.

> 技术项目经理的职责是查看他们所负责的项目的端到端执行情况。

Within the day-to-day, we use the Agile framework as a core part of our deliveries.

> 在日常工作中，我们使用敏捷框架作为交付的核心部分。

It allows us to iterate on the process, and it allows us to deliver products to our users much faster than traditional models.

> 它允许我们在过程中迭代，它允许我们比传统模型更快地向用户交付产品。

The Scrum framework is just a single implementation of the Agile methodology.

> Scrum框架只是敏捷方法的单一实现。

Scrum focuses on delivering rapid-迅速的,快速的 value to the customers and our users by working iteratively over short periods of time to deliver a product to our customers.

> Scrum专注于通过在短时间内迭代地向客户交付产品，为客户和用户快速交付价值。

At its core, Scrum is a self-organizing team, which means we bring individuals together.

> Scrum的核心是一个自组织团队，这意味着我们将个人聚集在一起。

So it's important that when we bring these individuals together, everyone is clear in the roles and responsibility that they lend to this team.

> 因此，重要的是，当我们把这些人聚集在一起时，每个人都清楚自己在这个团队中的角色和责任。

So it requires that there be a leader, or a Scrum Master, who helps to ensure that we're always working towards the same goal. 

> 所以它要求有一个领导者，或者Scrum Master，来帮助确保我们总是朝着同一个目标努力。

What makes an effective Scrum Master is one that has the following qualities-素质,特质: first, you're a good teacher and communicator. 

> 一个有效的Scrum Master需要具备以下素质:首先，你是一个好的老师和沟通者。

This is important because you need to instill-逐渐灌输 the Scrum values throughout the team.

> 这很重要，因为你需要在整个团队中灌输Scrum价值观。

Secondly, a Scrum Master best leads the team when he or she is influential-有影响力的,有势力的.

> 其次，当Scrum Master具有影响力时，他/她才能最好地领导团队。

In most cases, the Scrum Master does not have managerial responsibilities for the rest of the team, so it has to be through influence.

> 在大多数情况下，Scrum Master对团队的其他成员没有管理责任，所以它必须通过影响来实现。

And two key ways of doing this is to ensure that the team is operating effectively, and second, ensuring that there is a culture of motivation within the team.

> 做到这一点的两个关键方法是确保团队有效运作，第二，确保团队内部有一种激励的文化。

As a leader, you're also expected to give direction-方向 to the team and ensure that we're continuing to work towards the goals that we've set out to achieve during the Sprint.

> 作为一名领导者，你还需要为团队提供方向，并确保我们继续朝着我们在Sprint期间设定的目标努力。

And by Sprint, it's a focused effort towards particular, well-defined goals, and it's like a burst-爆发,爆炸,爆裂 of energy for the team to get us there.

> 而在Sprint中，它是朝着特定的、明确的目标集中的努力，就像团队的能量爆发一样，让我们达到目标。

I love the aspects of working with people and trying to come towards a common goal.

> 我喜欢和人们一起工作，努力朝着一个共同的目标前进。

It's not always easy, but it's always satisfying for me.

> 这并不总是容易的，但对我来说总是令人满意的。



## Traits of an effective Product Owner

> 一个有效的产品负责人的特征

Hi again.

In the last video, we reviewed the role of the Scrum Master.

---

Now, I'm going to give you an understanding of what the Product Owner does.

> 现在，我要让你们了解产品负责人是做什么的。

You'll also begin to notice how the relationship between the Product Owner and the Development Team works.

> 您还将开始注意到产品负责人和开发团队之间的关系是如何工作的。

A Product Owner is tasked with ensuring that the team is building the right product or service.

> 产品负责人的任务是确保团队正在构建正确的产品或服务。

An efficient Scrum Team isn't useful to anyone if they're creating a product that users don't want.

> 如果一个高效的Scrum团队正在创建一个用户不想要的产品，那么这个团队对任何人来说都是无用的。

The Product Owner ensures that the team is building the right thing.

> 产品负责人确保团队正在构建正确的东西。

A Product Owner is responsible for continuously maximizing the value of the product delivered by the Scrum Team.

> 产品负责人负责持续最大化Scrum团队交付的产品的价值。

Their key activity is acting as the voice of the customer within the team.

> 他们的主要活动是在团队中充当客户的代言人。

They represent-代表 and express-表达,体现 this voice through their ownership-所有权 of the Product Backlog.

> 他们通过对产品待办事项列表的所有权来代表和表达这种声音。

As a quick reminder, the Product Backlog is the single authoritative source for things that a Scrum Team works on to achieve the project goal.

> 提醒一下，产品待办事项列表是Scrum团队为实现项目目标所做工作的唯一权威来源。

The Product Owner's responsibilities also include helping the Scrum Team understand why their work matters-要紧,重要 within the overall goal and mission.

> 产品负责人的职责还包括帮助Scrum团队理解为什么他们的工作在总体目标和使命中很重要。

They also prioritize the Product Backlog to optimize-优化,充分利用 the delivery of goals and deliver value to customers.

> 他们还对产品待办事项列表进行优先排序，以优化目标的交付，并向客户交付价值。

The Product Owner ensures that the Product Backlog is visible and transparent to all.

> 产品负责人确保产品待办事项列表对所有人都是可见和透明的。

And finally, they're responsible for making sure that the product or service fulfills the customer's needs.

> 最后，他们有责任确保产品或服务满足客户的需求。

Phew, that's a lot.

> 哇，好多啊。

---

So how do Product Owners accomplish all of that?

> 那么产品负责人是如何完成这些工作的呢?

They rely on their key character-性格,品质 traits.

> 他们依赖于自己的关键性格特征。

A Product Owner's role requires them to be customer-focused, so they must understand a customer's needs and the industry of their business extremely well.

> 产品负责人的角色要求他们以客户为中心，因此他们必须非常了解客户的需求和他们的业务所在行业。

Product Owners also have to be **decisive-果断的,明确的**, great communicators, and understand both sides of the issue so they can defend-维护,保卫 their decisions to the team.

> 产品负责人还必须是果断的、优秀的沟通者，了解问题的双方，这样他们才能在团队中捍卫自己的决定。

They must be **flexible** and open to new information that can generate a profitable-盈利的,有益的,有用的 change for the team.

> 他们必须是灵活的，并且对能够为团队带来有利变化的新信息持开放态度。

They also have to be **optimistic-乐观的** and **positive**, especially since-什么时候 they're delivering the product vision to the team.

> 他们还必须保持乐观和积极的态度，尤其是在他们向团队传达产品愿景的时候。

And they must **inspire-激励,鼓舞** the team to believe in their mission.

> 他们必须激励团队相信他们的使命。

Product Owners also have to be **available**.

> 产品负责人也必须随时待命。

The iterative nature-本质 of Scrum means that the team needs the Product Owner to help inspect, adapt, and plan the next iteration on a regular basis.

> Scrum的迭代本质意味着团队需要产品负责人定期帮助检查、调整和计划下一次迭代。

And finally, they must be **collaborative**.

> 最后，它们必须是协作的。

Product Owners will have to work with their team to ensure that the customer's needs are met, and that will require meeting with and working alongside several stakeholders.

> 产品负责人必须与他们的团队合作，以确保满足客户的需求，这将需要与几个利益相关者会面并一起工作。

So as you may have noticed, the Product Owners are responsible for a lot of the project, just like the Scrum Master.

> 正如你可能已经注意到的，产品负责人负责项目的很多方面，就像Scrum Master一样。

---

Let's imagine an example of how a Product Owner will work within Virtual Verde.

> 让我们想象一个产品负责人如何在Virtual Verde中工作的例子。

For example, let's say that the Virtual Verde Product Owner told the Development Team that they need to work on the following features in this order-顺序: flower arrangements-安排,筹备, potted-盆栽的 succulents-多汁植物, large potted plants, and herb-草本植物 gardens-花园.

> 例如，假设Virtual Verde产品负责人告诉开发团队，他们需要按照以下顺序处理以下功能:插花、盆栽多肉植物、大型盆栽植物和草药花园。

When the Development Team reviews the list, they tell the Product Owner that herb gardens originally sounded difficult to deliver because they're considered regulated-监管,控制,管理 food items.

> 当开发团队审查列表时，他们告诉产品负责人，草本花园最初听起来很难交付，因为它们被认为是受监管的食品。

But in reality, the vendor specialist-专家 on the Development Team knows that herb gardens are actually way easier than we thought, because our vendor already has many herb gardens in stock.

> 但实际上，开发团队的供应商专家知道，草药花园实际上比我们想象的要容易得多，因为我们的供应商已经有很多草药花园库存。

So the Development Team suggests focusing on herb gardens first.

> 所以开发团队建议先专注于草本花园。

A Product Owner who is flexible and customer-focused will adjust the priorities based on this new information.

> 灵活且以客户为中心的产品负责人将根据这些新信息调整优先级。

---

So to recap, we discussed that a Product Owner acts as the voice of the customer and is customer-focused, decisive-果断的, flexible, optimistic, available, and collaborative.

> 所以总结一下，我们讨论过产品负责人作为客户的声音，并且以客户为中心，果断，灵活，乐观，可用和协作。

Next up, we'll discuss the role and traits of the Development Team.

> 接下来，我们将讨论开发团队的角色和特征。





## Traits of an effective Development Team

> 一个有效的开发团队的特征

Hi again.

In the previous video, we discussed the role of the Product Owner on the Scrum Team.

In this video, we'll discuss the Development Team within a Scrum Team.

---

The Development Team is made up of the people who do the work to build the product.

> 开发团队是由负责构建产品的人员组成的。

The size of the team ranges from three to nine people.

> 团队的规模从3人到9人不等。

This ensures that the team is small enough to remain nimble-灵活的,聪敏的 but large enough to complete significant work within each Sprint. 

> 这确保了团队足够小以保持灵活，但又足够大以在每个Sprint中完成重要的工作。

Getting the team size just right is important.

> 适当的团队规模非常重要。

Smaller teams can struggle-挣扎脱身 with diversity-多样性,多样化 of skills and ideas, while larger teams may run into issues where there are too many opinions and streams of communication.

> 较小的团队可能会在技能和想法的多样性中挣扎，而较大的团队可能会遇到太多意见和交流流的问题。

The Development Team should be cross-functional so they're capable-有能力的,有本领的 of building the product or service in-house since the team has all of the required skills.

> 开发团队应该是跨职能的，这样他们就能够在内部构建产品或服务，因为团队拥有所有所需的技能。

The Development Team also owns their processes and structures.

> 开发团队也拥有他们的过程和结构。

They have to be self-organizing and can't rely on others to tell them how to organize.

> 他们必须是自我组织的，不能依赖别人告诉他们如何组织。

They continuously operate as a team, rather than individuals, and they support each other in reaching the team's goals.

> 他们不断地作为一个团队而不是个人运作，并且他们在达到团队目标的过程中相互支持。

Lastly, the Development Team acknowledges-承认,认可 that the best products emerge-浮现,出现 from teams who are customer-oriented and focus on the user when building their products.

> 最后，开发团队承认，最好的产品来自于在构建产品时以客户为导向并关注用户的团队。

Many Scrum Teams prefer to be co-located-同地协作, meaning they work alongside each other in the same physical space.

> 许多Scrum团队更喜欢在一起工作，这意味着他们在同一个物理空间中彼此并肩工作。

Many believe the team delivers higher-quality work and improves faster if they're co-located.

> 许多人认为，如果团队成员共处一处，他们的工作质量会更高，进步也会更快。

But this isn't always possible for every team.

> 但并非每个团队都能做到这一点。

Let's take a look at an example.

Let's say that the Virtual Verde team discovers an issue with one of their plant vendors.

> 假设Virtual Verde团队发现了他们的一个植物供应商的问题。

They can't make the holiday rush-高峰 due to some product quality issues.

> 由于产品质量问题，他们不能赶上假日高峰。

The quality assurance specialist on the team can fly-飞 across-跨越 the country and help the vendor, but that means they won't be available to complete their assigned tasks.

> 团队中的质量保证专家可以飞到全国各地帮助供应商，但这意味着他们无法完成分配给他们的任务。

If the team is co-located-同地协作, they can quickly huddle in a conference-会议 room and write out some ideas to either get the work done or rearrange-重新整理,重新布置 the work so this doesn't impact the Sprint goals.

> 如果团队位于同一地点，他们可以迅速地挤在会议室里，写下一些想法，要么完成工作，要么重新安排工作，这样就不会影响Sprint目标。

If they don't sit together or work in different time zones, this collaboration is a bit harder, has to be done over phone or email, or you'll have to coordinate the schedules for a meeting, and you might have to come up with workarounds-变通方案,替代方法 that ultimately lead to overall project delays.

> 如果他们不坐在一起或在不同的时区工作，这种合作就会有点困难，必须通过电话或电子邮件完成，或者您必须协调会议的时间表，并且您可能不得不提出解决方案，最终导致整个项目延迟。

On the flip side, we live in a world where working virtually is possible.

> 另一方面，我们生活在一个虚拟工作成为可能的世界。

So if the quality assurance specialist needs to be on a call, they can dial in or join via videoconferencing-视频会议 platforms like Zoom or Skype.

> 因此，如果质量保证专家需要参加电话会议，他们可以拨打电话或通过Zoom或Skype等视频会议平台加入。

Both co-locating and working virtually has it's benefits-好处 and drawbacks-缺点,不利条件, so make sure to use whichever method is best for your team.

> 共同办公和工作都有其优点和缺点，所以要确保使用最适合你的团队的方法。

---

At this point, we've covered each role within a Scrum Team.

> 至此，我们已经涵盖了Scrum团队中的每个角色。

A Product Owner is responsible for meeting customers' needs, also known as "building the right thing."

> 产品负责人负责满足客户的需求，也被称为“构建正确的东西”。

A Development Team is responsible for creating the product, also known as "building the thing right."

> 开发团队负责创建产品，也被称为“构建正确的东西”。

The Scrum Master is responsible for improving efficiency, also known as "building the thing fast."

> Scrum Master负责提高效率，也就是“快速构建东西”。

We know that each role is vitally-极其 important to achieving the goals of a Scrum project.

> 我们知道每个角色对于实现Scrum项目的目标都是至关重要的。

No individual is more or less important than the others.

> 没有人比其他人更重要或更不重要。

They all work together as a team to create value for their users and customers.

> 他们作为一个团队一起工作，为他们的用户和客户创造价值。

In the next set of videos, we'll review what you've learned so far.

> 在下一组视频中，我们将复习到目前为止学到的知识。



## Understanding Scrum Team roles

> 理解 Scrum 团队角色

Each Scrum Team member plays a vital role in the project’s success.

> 每个Scrum团队成员在项目的成功中都扮演着至关重要的角色。

In order to help a project get to the finish line, you will need to understand what each of these roles entail-使必要,需要.

> 为了帮助项目顺利完成，您需要了解每个角色的职责。

In this reading, you will learn how the responsibilities of the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team differ from one another.

> 在本文中，您将了解Scrum Master、产品负责人和开发团队的职责是如何相互区别的。

---

**The Scrum Master**

One key responsibility of the **Scrum Master** is to help the team understand and follow Scrum theory.

> Scrum Master的一个关键职责是帮助团队理解和遵循Scrum理论。

More specifically, according to the Scrum Guide, “The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide.

> 更具体地说，根据Scrum指南，“Scrum Master负责建立Scrum指南中定义的Scrum。

They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the Organization.

> 他们通过帮助Scrum团队和组织中的每个人理解Scrum理论和实践来做到这一点。

The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness.

> Scrum Master对Scrum团队的有效性负责。

They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.”

> 他们通过使Scrum团队能够在Scrum框架内改进其实践来做到这一点。”

The Scrum Master makes sure that important meetings occur, like the Daily Scrum.

> Scrum管理员确保重要会议的召开，比如每日Scrum。

In the same way that a coach would be aware of the game clock, the Scrum Master is tasked with making sure that the meeting is kept within the appropriate **timebox**.

> 就像教练知道比赛时间一样，Scrum Master的任务是确保会议在适当的时间范围内进行。

A timebox is a Scrum concept that refers to the estimated-估计,判断 duration for an event.

> 时间框是一个Scrum概念，指的是一个事件的估计持续时间。

The Scrum Master acts as a coach to the Scrum Team—they encourage the team to build the product in the time frame.

> Scrum Master是Scrum团队的教练，他们鼓励团队在规定的时间内构建产品。

They also support the team by creating a collaborative environment so the project’s goals are achieved.

> 他们还通过创建协作环境来支持团队，从而实现项目目标。

The Scrum Master’s duties include: 

> Scrum Master的职责包括:

- Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality

	> 在自我管理和跨职能方面指导团队成员

- Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the **Definition of Done** (an agreed upon set of items that must be completed before a project or user story can be considered complete)

	> 帮助Scrum团队专注于创造高价值的增量，以满足完成定义(在项目或用户故事被认为完成之前必须完成的一组商定的项目)。

- Causing the removal-移除,消除 of impediments-妨碍,障碍 to the Scrum Team’s progress

	> 消除Scrum团队进展中的障碍

- Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive-富有成效的,多产的, and kept within the **timebox** (a Scrum concept that refers to the estimated duration for an event)

	> 确保所有Scrum事件的发生，并且是积极的、富有成效的，并保持在时间框内(一个Scrum概念，指的是一个事件的估计持续时间)。

---

**Scrum Master vs. project manager** 

The role of the Scrum Master is sometimes confused-混淆 with the role of the project manager.

> Scrum Master的角色有时会与项目经理的角色混淆。

While the two roles share related skills and qualities-素质, they are very different roles.

> 虽然这两个角色共享相关的技能和素质，但它们是非常不同的角色。

A Scrum Master is responsible for helping the team understand Scrum theory and practice.

> Scrum Master负责帮助团队理解Scrum理论和实践。

They ensure Scrum events take place and help the team focus on delivering value by removing impediments.

> 它们确保Scrum事件的发生，并帮助团队通过消除障碍专注于交付价值。

But unlike a traditional project manager, they do not take on the management of changes in scope or priorities.

> 但与传统的项目经理不同，他们不承担范围或优先级变更的管理。

Additionally, Scrum Masters do not maintain traditional project artifacts like Gantt charts. 

> 此外，Scrum master不维护像甘特图这样的传统项目工件。

---

**The Product Owner**

According to the Scrum Guide, “The **Product Owner** is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Scrum Team.

> 根据Scrum指南，“产品负责人负责最大化Scrum团队工作所产生的产品价值。

How this is done may vary-不同,改变 widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.”

> 如何做到这一点在不同的组织、Scrum团队和个人之间可能会有很大的不同。”

Product Owners maximize the value of the product by representing and expressing-表现,体现 the voice of the customer throughout the project duration.

> 产品负责人通过在整个项目期间代表和表达客户的声音来最大化产品的价值。

A product isn’t useful to its customers if that product doesn’t fulfill their expectations and meet their needs.

> 如果一个产品不能满足顾客的期望和需求，那么这个产品对顾客来说就是没有用的。

The Product Owner’s duties include:

> 产品负责人的职责包括:

- Developing and explicitly-直截了当地,明确地 communicating the Product Goal

	> 开发并明确传达产品目标

- Creating and clearly communicating **Product Backlog** items (The Product Backlog contains all of the features, requirements, and activities associated with deliverables to achieve the goal of the project.)

	> 创建并清晰地传达产品待办事项列表(产品待办事项列表包含与实现项目目标的可交付成果相关的所有特性、需求和活动)。

- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible, and understood

	> 确保产品待办事项列表是透明的、可见的和可理解的

---

**Product Owner vs. project manager**

In traditional project management, scope management is the primary responsibility of the project manager.

> 在传统的项目管理中，范围管理是项目经理的主要职责。

But in Scrum, the definition and management of product scope falls to the Product Owner.

> 但是在Scrum中，产品范围的定义和管理由产品负责人负责。

Conversely-相反地,反过来说, the Product Owner isn’t responsible for team performance—they aren’t considered to be a manager.

> 相反，产品负责人不负责团队绩效——他们不被认为是经理。

The project manager leads the project team to meet the project’s objectives and oversees-监管,监督 tasks and progress.

> 项目经理领导项目团队实现项目目标，监督任务和进度。

There are also similarities between the Product Owner and project manager roles.

> 产品负责人和项目经理角色之间也有相似之处。

For instance, both roles are tasked with stakeholder management.

> 例如，这两个角色的任务都是管理涉众。

This means they both must practice and facilitate effective communication among team members and stakeholders.

> 这意味着他们都必须实践并促进团队成员和涉众之间的有效沟通。

Additionally, in many companies—including Google—the definition of product or solution scope is the responsibility of a separate-单独的,分开的 role called a **product manager**.

> 此外，在许多公司(包括google)中，产品或解决方案范围的定义是由一个叫做产品经理的独立角色负责的。

So, it is important when joining any new company to discover-发现,找到 how that company approaches the area of product definition, requirements development, and user research to understand what they consider to be the domain of the project manager. 

> 因此，在加入任何一家新公司时，了解该公司如何处理产品定义、需求开发和用户研究领域，以了解他们认为哪些是项目经理的领域是很重要的。

**The Development Team**

The **Development Team**, also referred to as **Developers**, is made up of the people who do the work to build the product. 

> **开发团队**，也被称为**开发人员**，由负责构建产品的人员组成。

According to the Scrum Guide, Developers are “the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.”

> 根据Scrum指南，开发人员是“Scrum团队中致力于在每个Sprint中创建可用增量的任何方面的人”。

Their responsibilities include: 

> 他们的职责包括:

- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the **Sprint Backlog** (the set of Product Backlog items that are selected to be completed during the upcoming Sprint)

	> 为Sprint创建一个计划，即Sprint待办事项(在即将到来的Sprint中选择完成的产品待办事项的集合)

- Instilling-逐渐灌输 quality by adhering to a Definition of Done

	> 通过坚持“完成”的定义来灌输质量

- Adapting their plan each day toward-朝着,向着 the Sprint Goal

	> 每天调整他们的计划以实现“冲刺目标”

- Holding each other accountable as professionals

	> 作为专业人士互相督促

- Executing sprints by designing, building, and testing Product Backlog items in increments

	> 通过设计、构建和测试产品待办事项列表项来执行sprint

An important aspect of the Development Team that is worth highlighting is that they are cross-functional, meaning that you will have team members who are specialists-专家 in different disciplines-科目,学科.

> 开发团队值得强调的一个重要方面是他们是跨职能的，这意味着您将拥有不同学科的专家团队成员。

In a software team, that might mean having a web developer, a database developer, and a user experience specialist.

> 在一个软件团队中，这可能意味着有一个网络开发人员，一个数据库开发人员和一个用户体验专家。

In a marketing team, that might mean having writers, editors, search engine optimization specialists, and business analysts. 

> 在营销团队中，这可能意味着有作家、编辑、搜索引擎优化专家和业务分析师。

**The roles working together**

The Scrum roles fit together, and each brings their unique qualities, skills, and responsibilities jointly to lead to successful Scrum projects.

> Scrum角色相互配合，每个角色都有自己独特的品质、技能和职责，共同促成Scrum项目的成功。

It is crucial for everyone on the team to understand their role and how they work together to deliver value to their users and customers.

> 对于团队中的每个人来说，理解他们的角色以及他们如何共同为用户和客户提供价值是至关重要的。

When the team has this shared understanding, they can better support each other during the practices of Scrum. 

> 当团队拥有这种共同的理解时，他们可以在Scrum实践中更好地相互支持。

**Necessary traits for each role** 

Overall, you will want people on your team who are interested in constant-持续不断的,经常发生的 collaboration and improvement.

> 总的来说，你会希望你的团队中有人对持续的合作和改进感兴趣。

More specifically, it is great to have team members who value feedback, bring energy and fun to the team, and can admit-承认,接纳 and learn from their mistakes.

> 更具体地说，拥有重视反馈、给团队带来活力和乐趣、能够承认错误并从中吸取教训的团队成员是件好事。

Let’s look at what traits each team member should exhibit-展出:

> 让我们来看看每个团队成员应该表现出哪些特征:

The Product Owner should be able to confidently provide the team with general direction, requirements, and objectives for the project but will allow the team to determine how to accomplish these goals.

> 产品负责人应该能够自信地向团队提供项目的总体方向、需求和目标，并允许团队决定如何完成这些目标。

Your team will want a Product Owner who promotes-促进,提倡 the product vision and prioritizes the product backlog to maximize the value for the customer.

> 你的团队需要一个产品负责人，他能促进产品愿景，并对产品待办事项安排进行优先级排序，从而最大限度地为客户创造价值。

In order to deliver on this, the Product Owner should be organized and have strong communication skills.

> 为了实现这一点，产品负责人应该有条理，并具有很强的沟通技巧。



The Scrum Master should have strong leadership skills that enable them to be efficient facilitators and negotiators-谈判者 who know how to resolve conflict-争执,冲突.

> Scrum Master应该有很强的领导能力，使他们能够成为高效的促进者和谈判者，知道如何解决冲突。

Your team will want a Scrum Master who aims to effectively coach the Development Team, facilitate events, and eliminate-剔除,根除 distractions-干扰 that may impede-妨碍,阻碍 the team’s progress. 

> 您的团队将需要一个Scrum Master，他的目标是有效地指导开发团队，促进事件的发生，并消除可能阻碍团队进展的干扰。



When it comes to the Development Team, you will want individuals who remain focused on completing deliverables and producing a superior-卓越的,优质的 final product.

> 当涉及到开发团队时，您将希望个人保持专注于完成可交付成果并产生卓越的最终产品。

Since the team is self-organizing and cross-functional, you will want people who are eager-热切的,渴望的 to work together and not afraid to compromise-折中,妥协 for the greater good of the product. 

> 由于团队是自组织和跨职能的，您需要的是那些渴望一起工作，并且不害怕为了产品的更大利益而妥协的人。

# Review: Scrum 101

## Wrap-up

Congrats on finishing a new section!

You're on your way to becoming a Scrum expert.

Throughout these videos, we've extensively-广阔地,广泛地 reviewed a theory in the Agile framework called Scrum.

> 在这些视频中，我们广泛地回顾了敏捷框架中一个叫做Scrum的理论。

As a refresher, Scrum is the most common framework that uses an Agile approach, but there are others, like Kanban or Lean.

> 作为复习，Scrum是使用敏捷方法的最常见框架，但也有其他框架，如看板或精益。

We discussed those approaches in previous videos.

I introduced you to every Scrum Team member's source of truth-真理,原理, the Scrum Guide, which you can always use as a resource.

> 我向您介绍了每个Scrum团队成员的真理来源，Scrum指南，您可以随时将其作为资源使用。

We discussed the Scrum theory, which has three pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

And we explored the five Scrum values: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect.

We went over the essential roles on a Scrum Team.

You may remember that those roles are the Scrum Master, who ensures the team builds the thing fast;the Product Owner, who is **in charge of**-负责 building the right thing; and the Development Team, whose role is to ensure the team builds the thing right.

It's quite a feat that you've gotten this far in the program, so I hope you're really proud-自豪的 of yourself.

> 你能在这个项目中走到这一步已经很了不起了，我希望你为自己感到骄傲。

I'll meet you in the next section, where we'll discuss how to implement Scrum.
