# Understanding value-driven delivery

> 5 - video、3-reading material

## Introduction: Applying Agile in the organization

Hi there.

In the previous section, we wrapped up how to run a project using Scrum.

> 在上一节中，我们总结了如何使用Scrum运行一个项目。

I introduced you to the day-to-day practices that most Scrum Teams use.

> 我向您介绍了大多数Scrum团队使用的日常实践。

These practices include developing user stories, managing a Product Backlog, and running Sprints.

> 这些实践包括开发用户故事，管理产品待办事项列表，以及运行sprint。

---

In this next section, we're going to take an even wider view of Scrum and Agile.

> 在下一节中，我们将以更广泛的视角来看待Scrum和Agile。

I'll introduce you to how to use Scrum and Agile in your daily life.

> 我将向您介绍如何在日常生活中使用Scrum和敏捷。

I'll help prepare you to apply Agile thinking and methods to both job interviews and potential work scenarios.

> 我将帮助您准备好将敏捷思维和方法应用于工作面试和潜在的工作场景。

These work scenarios will teach you how to implement Agile to deliver value and achieve your business goals.

> 这些工作场景将教会您如何实现敏捷来交付价值并实现业务目标。

You'll also learn some techniques for responding to risks and team dynamics.

> 您还将学习一些应对风险和团队动态的技巧。

Finally, I'm going to wrap up this course on the foundations of Agile by discussing Agile as it applies to the broader-更广泛,广大的 project management discipline-科目,学科.

> 最后，我将通过讨论敏捷在更广泛的项目管理学科中的应用来结束这门关于敏捷基础的课程。

I'll help you figure out how to use Agile in your next position.

> 我将帮助您弄清楚如何在下一个职位上使用敏捷。

Ready for the final stretch-一片,一段 of this Agile journey?

> 准备好进入敏捷旅程的最后一段了吗?

Let's go.



## Maximizing value-driven delivery

> 最大化价值驱动交付

Hi again.

Previously, you learned how to effectively implement Scrum so that you and your team can deliver amazing products to your users.

> 之前，你学习了如何有效地实施Scrum，以便你和你的团队能够向用户交付令人惊叹的产品。

In this video, we'll explore the result of a project and the end product you'll ultimately deliver, which is what holds value for the user and the customer.

> 在本视频中，我们将探讨项目的结果和最终交付的最终产品，这对用户和客户来说是有价值的。

I'm going to define the term value as it relates to project management.

> 我将定义与项目管理相关的术语“价值”。

Then, I'll share some strategies and tactics you can employ-使用,利用,雇佣 to maximize the value your team delivers.

> 然后，我将分享一些策略和战术，您可以使用这些策略和战术来最大化您的团队交付的价值。

---

The end product of a project is what provides value to the user.

> 项目的最终产品是为用户提供价值的东西。

Value could be financial benefits, user growth and engagement, or compliance-遵守 adherence-遵守,坚持.

> 价值可以是经济利益，用户增长和参与，或遵从性。

The term "value" can mean different things for each customer based on what they expect the product to accomplish.

> 根据客户对产品的期望，“价值”一词的含义可能不同。

The number one Agile principle is to satisfy the customer by delivering valuable software.

> 敏捷的首要原则是通过交付有价值的软件来满足客户。

You can always replace the term software with the words product or solution for non-software related projects.

> 对于与软件无关的项目，您总是可以用产品或解决方案来替换术语软件。

Delivering value as quickly and efficiently as possible to users is the primary reason Agile came into existence-存在,生存.

> 尽可能快速有效地向用户交付价值是敏捷产生的主要原因。

The term "value-driven delivery" means you and your team are focused on delivering a product of high value.

> 术语“价值驱动的交付”意味着您和您的团队专注于交付高价值的产品。

Just because you deliver a product, that doesn't mean it's valuable.

> 仅仅因为你交付了一个产品，并不意味着它是有价值的。

As I explained during the overview of Agile history, there was a growing problem of project teams churning out products that weren't very valuable.

> 正如我在敏捷历史概述中所解释的那样，项目团队大量生产的产品并不是很有价值，这是一个日益严重的问题。

This is because teams were focused on the process and weren't taking the time to evaluate-评价,评估 the usefulness of the product until the very end, after it had been delivered.

> 这是因为团队关注的是过程，而没有花时间去评估产品的有用性，直到最后，在产品交付之后。

Agile redirects-重新导向,使改变 the team's focus to be about the product and ensures that the process for producing the product supports the goal of delivering value.

> 敏捷将团队的焦点重新定向到产品上，并确保生产产品的过程支持交付价值的目标。

How can you make sure your team is focused on value-driven delivery?

> 如何确保您的团队专注于价值驱动的交付?

Build the right thing, build the thing right, and run it right.

> 构建正确的东西，构建正确的东西，并正确地运行它。

Remember, Agile and Scrum evolved **out of**-从…中来 the software industry.

> 请记住，敏捷和Scrum是从软件行业发展而来的。

The terms "build" and "run" describe processes for building or running a software program, machine, or other technology.

> 术语“构建”和“运行”描述了构建或运行软件程序、机器或其他技术的过程。

You can replace the words "build" and "run" with terms like "create," "produce," or "deliver" for non-software projects to describe the same concept.

> 对于非软件项目，您可以用“创建”、“生产”或“交付”等术语代替“构建”和“运行”来描述相同的概念。

---

Let's break this down.

First and foremost-最前的,最重要的, to deliver value, you have to build the right thing.

> 首先，要传递价值，你必须构建正确的东西。

You can do this by making sure you really understand what your customers want.

> 你可以通过确保你真正了解你的客户想要什么来做到这一点。

You might ask the customer what they want, and they may say they want to build a website to promote-推广 their new plant service. 

> 你可能会问客户他们想要什么，他们可能会说他们想建立一个网站来推广他们的新植物服务。

But take this one step further and ask about their goals.

> 但是更进一步，问问他们的目标是什么。

Do they want to increase their brand recognition?

> 他们想提高自己的品牌认知度吗?

Do they want to get more customers?

> 他们想要获得更多的客户吗?

Having a solution-oriented conversation with your customer will help you build the right thing.

> 与您的客户进行以解决方案为导向的对话将帮助您构建正确的东西。

The Agile value of "individuals and interactions over processes and tools" extends-延伸,扩大 beyond just the team.

> “个人和交互胜过过程和工具”的敏捷价值不仅仅局限于团队。

It refers to having those important interactions with our customers and users, too.

> 它也指的是与我们的客户和用户进行那些重要的互动。

---

Next, you must build the thing right.

> 接下来，你必须正确地构建这个东西。

That's lingo-行话,术语 for ensuring that your team only builds the requested or approved features.

> 这是确保您的团队只构建请求或批准的功能的行话。

Working on features that aren't necessary can lead to complexities in the product that don't add any value to the users.

> 在不必要的功能上工作可能会导致产品的复杂性，并且不会给用户增加任何价值。

In addition, building more than you need delays or reduces your value upon delivery.

> 此外，构建超出您需要的东西会延迟或降低您在交付时的价值。

It also increases the risk of bugs or other issues down the road.

> 它还会增加出现bug或其他问题的风险。

---

Finally, **in addition to**-除了…之外,另外 building the right thing and building the thing right, you have to make sure that you're running it right.

> 最后，除了构建正确的东西和正确地构建东西之外，你还必须确保你在正确地运行它。

To run it right means that your team has thought-考虑 through how the user will interact with the product once it's been delivered. 

> 正确地运行它意味着你的团队已经考虑过一旦产品交付，用户将如何与产品交互。

Make sure your team thinks through some of the operational-操作的,运营的 tasks that will need to be addressed after the product has left the door.

> 确保你的团队考虑过产品发布后需要解决的一些操作任务。

Ask the following questions:

How do users get support?

> 用户如何获得支持?

How does the product add value to users long after they initially-开始,最初 received it?

> 产品如何在用户最初使用后很长一段时间内为他们增加价值?

How do you make sure that new features and capabilities-能力,功能 reach the existing users?

> 您如何确保新特性和功能能够覆盖现有用户?

Building the right thing, building the thing right, and running it right all work together to ensure that the team creates a steady-稳定的 and continuous delivery of value to users throughout the life of the product.

> 构建正确的东西，构建正确的东西，并正确地运行它，所有这些都一起工作，以确保团队在产品的整个生命周期中为用户创造稳定和持续的价值交付。

Let's consider how the Virtual Verde team can ensure that they focus on value-driven delivery.

> 让我们考虑一下Virtual Verde团队如何确保他们专注于价值驱动的交付。

First, how could the Virtual Verde team ensure they build the right thing?

> 首先，Virtual Verde团队如何确保他们构建的是正确的东西?

How do they know they're creating something the customer really wants?

> 他们怎么知道他们在创造顾客真正想要的东西?

In this case, the team needs to ensure that they create a service providing the types of plants that customers want to buy.

> 在这种情况下，团队需要确保他们创建了提供客户想要购买的植物类型的服务。

They could create a survey that asked current and potential customers what their plant preferences-偏爱,偏好 are and the type of home office design they want to create.

> 他们可以做一个调查，询问现有的和潜在的客户他们对植物的偏好是什么，以及他们想要创造的家庭办公室设计类型。

Then they'll use this data to update the user stories on their Product Backlog.

> 然后，他们将使用这些数据来更新产品待办事项列表中的用户故事。

Next, how could the Virtual Verde team ensure they build the thing right?

> 接下来，Virtual Verde团队如何确保他们构建的东西是正确的?

Once the team knows what kinds of plants and designs the customer wants, how do they ensure the right processes are in place to deliver them?

> 一旦团队知道客户想要什么样的植物和设计，他们如何确保正确的流程到位来交付它们?

Well, the team can secure-可靠的,安全的 a trusted plant vendor that carries the desired plant types and work with designers to make pots, vases, and other plant accessories-配件,配饰 in the different design styles that customers like.

> 好吧，团队可以找到一个值得信赖的植物供应商，提供所需的植物类型，并与设计师合作，以客户喜欢的不同设计风格制作花盆、花瓶和其他植物配件。

The team can also communicate with marketing to make sure the types of plants and designs that customers want are prominently-显著地 featured on the website and in the catalog.

> 该团队还可以与营销部门沟通，以确保客户想要的植物类型和设计在网站和目录中有显著的特色。

Finally, how can the Virtual Verde team makes sure to run it right?

> 最后，Virtual Verde团队如何确保正确运行它?

How do they ensure customer satisfaction once a customer has signed up for the service?

> 一旦客户注册了服务，他们如何确保客户满意度?

How does the Virtual Verde team retain their customers long after their plants have been delivered?

> Virtual Verde团队如何在植物交付后很长一段时间内留住客户?

The Virtual Verde team can send out follow-up customer satisfaction surveys that ask about their plant and design offerings, delivery times, plant quality, and other insights.

> Virtual Verde团队可以发送后续客户满意度调查，询问他们的工厂和设计产品、交货时间、工厂质量和其他见解。

The team can then use this data to continually evaluate their vendors, plant and design offerings-产品, and marketing-营销 strategy.

> 然后，团队可以使用这些数据持续评估他们的供应商、工厂和设计产品，以及营销策略。

For example, the team could find ways to increase the quality of service by offering watering cans and automatic plant health systems, or even free monthly gardening-园艺 tips, so the user feels empowered and supported to maintain their plants.

> 例如，该团队可以通过提供浇水罐和自动植物健康系统，甚至每月免费的园艺技巧，找到提高服务质量的方法，这样用户就会感到有能力和支持来维护他们的植物。

There are many ways to maximize your team's value delivery.

> 有很多方法可以最大化团队的价值交付。

Building the right thing, building the thing right, and running it right all work together to ensure that the team delivers value to users.

In the next video, I'll teach you another effective, proven-被证明的,已证实的 way to deliver value called a value roadmap.

> 在下一个视频中，我将教你另一种有效的、经过验证的交付价值的方法，即价值路线图。

Meet you there.



## Case study: Forming a value-driven task force-一群人,有影响力的人

> 案例研究:组建一个价值驱动的工作小组

In the previous video, you learned that value-driven delivery is critical to Agile and Scrum project management.

In this reading, you will read a case study and analyze how Agile brought value to the organization. 

> 在本文中，您将阅读一个案例研究，并分析敏捷如何为组织带来价值。

---

**Learning from case studies**

As you pursue your career in project management, you will come across many resources for learning about other companies and their journeys to becoming-相配的,合适的 Agile. 

> 当你在项目管理中追求你的职业生涯时，你会遇到许多资源来学习其他公司和他们的敏捷之旅。

**Case studies**—in-depth, data-driven analyses of a business, community, or organization—are valuable tools for gaining key industry insights and learning from the successes and failures of your competitors-竞争者. 

> 案例研究——对企业、社区或组织进行深入的、数据驱动的分析——是获得关键行业洞察力和从竞争对手的成功和失败中学习的宝贵工具。

When reading case studies, focus on the problem, the effect it had on the business or organization, and the pros-赞成者,优点 and cons-反对者,缺点 of the solutions reached to help you determine some applicable-适用的,适当的 key takeaways.

> 在阅读案例研究时，关注问题，它对业务或组织的影响，以及所达成的解决方案的优点和缺点，以帮助您确定一些适用的关键要点。

As you read, ask yourself: 

- What is the issue?

	> 问题是什么?

- What is the goal of the analysis?

	> 分析的目标是什么?

- What is the context of the problem?

	> 问题的背景是什么?

- What key facts should be considered?

	> 应该考虑哪些关键事实?

- What alternatives-备选的,可替代的 are available to the decision-maker?

	> 决策者有哪些选择?

- What would you recommend, and why?

	> 你会推荐什么，为什么?

**Value-driven delivery at Sephora**

The case study linked below is about how the teams at Sephora, the multinational-跨国的 retailer-零售商,零售店 of personal care and beauty products, created **value-driven delivery** by forming an Agile task force. 

> 下面链接的案例研究是关于个人护理和美容产品的跨国零售商丝芙兰(Sephora)的团队如何通过组建敏捷工作组来创造价值驱动的交付。

As the case study details, Sephora’s goal was to develop an organized and efficient process for rolling out customer-centered initiatives.

> 正如案例研究的细节，丝芙兰的目标是开发一个有组织和有效的流程，以推出以客户为中心的举措。

The beauty retailer wanted to maximize their paid media-媒体 and create custom messaging that was personalized to meet their customers’ needs.

> 这家美容产品零售商希望最大限度地利用他们的付费媒体，并创建个性化的定制信息，以满足客户的需求。

Keep the questions above in mind as you read through the case study.

> 在阅读案例研究时，请牢记上述问题。

Notice how the various roles and responsibilities were essential to the process and how the company brought people from across the organization together to ideate-构思,想象,设想, test, and analyze. 

> 请注意不同的角色和职责是如何对流程至关重要的，以及公司是如何将组织中的人员聚集在一起进行构思、测试和分析的。

When you are finished, think about how Scrum benefitted Sephora and how it improved their overall business model.

> 当你完成后，想想Scrum如何使丝芙兰受益，以及它如何改进了他们的整体商业模式。

## Camron: How Agile can drive value

> Camron:敏捷如何驱动价值

My name is Camron.

I'm a technical program manager.

A technical program manager is a program manager with a technical background that enables him to engage in technical conversations or decisions with their team.

> 技术项目经理是具有技术背景的项目经理，这使他能够与团队进行技术对话或决策。

My favorite thing about Agile has got to be the flexibility.

> 我最喜欢敏捷的一点就是它的灵活性。

So when you're making most of the decisions at the beginning, when you know the least, not all those decisions might be right. 

> 所以当你在一开始做大多数决定时，当你知道的最少的时候，并不是所有的决定都是正确的。

Some will, but probably all of them won't be.

> 有些人会，但可能不是所有人都会。

So with Agile, it's a framework and a mindset that is open to that change that embraces-拥抱,欣然接受 it.

> 因此，对于敏捷，它是一个框架和一种心态，它对拥抱它的变化是开放的。

It welcomes it as you learn more.

> 它欢迎你学到更多。

Agile gives you built in opportunities to make changes.

> 敏捷为您提供了进行更改的内在机会。

An important aspect of Agile is incremental-增量 delivery.

> 敏捷的一个重要方面是增量交付。

You're delivering little bits over the course of a long period of time.

> 在很长一段时间里，你只交付了一点点。

To contrast-形成对比,对比,对照 that, you could think of Waterfall—that's when you deliver everything at once to the customer at the end.

> 与之形成对比的是，你可以想象一下瀑布式——你在最后一次将所有东西交付给客户。

In a Waterfall project, you have to wait and wait and wait until the very end to get everything, and perhaps you're waiting days, months, years, and you cannot extract-提取,提炼 any value out of it until the very end until the product is delivered.

> 在瀑布项目中，你必须等待，等待，等待，直到最后才能得到所有东西，也许你要等待几天，几个月，几年，直到最后，直到产品交付，你才能从中获得任何价值。

I think that makes sense for a house.

> 我觉得这对房子来说很有意义。

I think that makes sense for a car.

> 我认为这对汽车来说是有意义的。

I cannot give someone parts of a car and have them start getting value out of it

> 我不能把汽车的零件给别人，然后让他们开始从中获利

because a car has certain safety requirements.

> 因为汽车有一定的安全要求。

For things that take longer to figure out, for more challenging design issues, you don't have to sacrifice-牺牲,献出 the entire project for that one last bit.

> 对于需要较长时间才能弄清楚的内容，对于更具挑战性的设计问题，您不必为了最后一点而牺牲整个项目。

If you built 90% of the project and you can ship it, go ahead.

> 如果你完成了项目的90%并且可以发布，那就继续吧。

Agile lets you extract that value.

> 敏捷让你提取这个价值。

That way people can use that 90% while you're trying to figure out that last ten.

> 这样人们就可以使用这90%，而你却在努力找出剩下的10%。

And then hopefully you have an ecosystem-生态系统 where it's okay to deploy or release that last 10% down the line.

> 然后希望你有一个生态系统，在那里可以部署或发布最后的10%。

Change is never free.

> 改变从来都不是免费的。

Because you've already communicated plans, you've already made estimates, you already have some work in progress.

> 因为你已经沟通了计划，你已经做了估计，你已经有了一些正在进行的工作。

Then if you're going to change that, you're going to lose a little bit.

> 如果你要改变这一点，你就会损失一点。

Is that change within your threshold-阈值 or your budget to be able to adapt to get it right or get it better.

> 这种变化是否在你的阈值或预算范围内，以适应它，使其正确或更好。

It's not always about it being perfect.

> 它并不总是完美的。

It's about it being good.

> 这是关于它是好的。



## Components of a value roadmap

> 价值路线图的组成部分

Hello again.

In the last video, you learned about value-driven delivery, which is when the team is focused on delivering a product that has maximum value for its customers.

> 在上一个视频中，您了解了价值驱动交付，这是指团队专注于为客户交付具有最大价值的产品。

One way to help teams make sure they're staying focused is by following a value roadmap.

> 帮助团队确保他们保持专注的一种方法是遵循价值路线图。

In this video, I'll explain what a value roadmap is and what you need to create one.

> 在这个视频中，我将解释什么是价值路线图，以及创建一个价值路线图需要什么。

As a project manager, part of your job is to help team stay focused on delivering value.

> 作为项目经理，你的部分工作是帮助团队专注于交付价值。

A great way to do this is to build a value roadmap.

> 这样做的一个好方法是构建一个价值路线图。

It's an Agile way of mapping out the timelines and requirements for the product development process and can be used in all types of businesses.

> 这样做的一个好方法是构建一个价值路线图。这是一种为产品开发过程制定时间表和需求的敏捷方法，可用于所有类型的业务。

This roadmap is a guide that demonstrates where to go, how to get there, and what to accomplish along the way in order to maximize value.

> 这个路线图是一个指南，它展示了要去哪里，如何到达那里，以及为了实现价值最大化，在这个过程中要完成什么。

---

It helps map out a product idea and the strategy for how to deliver it.

> 它有助于规划出一个产品创意和如何实现它的策略。

As the team follows their roadmap, they gather input from customers and stakeholders and apply their findings to each iteration of the product.

> 当团队遵循他们的路线图时，他们从客户和涉众那里收集输入，并将他们的发现应用到产品的每次迭代中。

Creating a roadmap helps the team explain the vision of the product and can also be used to identify important milestones.

> 创建路线图可以帮助团队解释产品的愿景，也可以用来确定重要的里程碑。

A typical value roadmap has three components: a product vision, a product roadmap, and release plans.

> 一个典型的价值路线图有三个组成部分：产品远景、产品路线图和发布计划。

---

The first component of a value roadmap is the product vision.

> 价值路线图的第一个组成部分是产品远景。

Your product vision is a critical step to starting any new Scrum project.

> 你的产品愿景是开始任何新的Scrum项目的关键一步。

Your vision is based on your user interviews and market analysis and becomes your team's north-北,北极 star-星.

> 你的愿景是基于你的用户访谈和市场分析，并成为你的团队的北极星。

In other words, it's what guides your team.

> 换句话说，就是指导你的团队。

The product vision defines what the product is, how it supports the customer's business strategy, and who will use it.

> 产品愿景定义了产品是什么，它如何支持客户的业务策略，以及谁将使用它。

---

Next, there's the product roadmap, which the Product Owner is responsible for creating and maintaining.

> 接下来是产品路线图，产品负责人负责创建和维护。

It provides a high-level view of the expected product, its requirements, and an estimated schedule for reaching milestones.

> 它提供了预期产品、其需求和达到里程碑的估计进度表的高级视图。

It's key to making sure your team is building the right thing.

> 这是确保你的团队做正确事情的关键。

---

The third component of a value roadmap is a series-连续,一系列 of release plans.

> 价值路线图的第三个组成部分是一系列的发布计划。

The Product Owner and project manager work together to develop these plans.

> 产品负责人和项目经理一起制定这些计划。

Product releases occur when the team has developed a basic working version of a given feature or requirement.

> 当团队开发出给定特性或需求的基本工作版本时，就会发布产品。

A release plan includes the approximate-大概的,类似,接近 date when the team is expected to release and deliver certain features to the customer or user.

> 发布计划包括团队预期向客户或用户发布和交付某些特性的大致日期。

An Agile team may have several releases over the course of a project until their project is considered done.

> 敏捷团队在项目过程中可能会有几个版本，直到他们的项目被认为已经完成。

For this reason, only the first release date should be considered to be **set in stone**-确定的.

> 出于这个原因，只有第一个发布日期应该被认为是一成不变的。

The rest of the release plan is based on early estimates and is subject to change as the project proceeds.

> 发布计划的其余部分是基于早期估计的，并且随着项目的进行可能会发生变化。

A release plan contains a release goal, which is an overall business goal for the features you plan to include in the release;

> 发布计划包含发布目标，这是您计划在发布中包含的特性的总体业务目标;

the list of Backlog items such as epics, user stories, or features that you require for that release goal;

> 待办事项列表，如史诗、用户故事或发布目标所需的特性;

an estimated release date;

> 预计发布日期;

and any other relevant dates that impact a release, like a convention-会议 or major holiday.

> 以及影响发行的任何其他相关日期，如会议或重大节日。

It's important to add all of your release plans to your value roadmap to help you stay focused on the path to your overall value goal.

---

In summary, the value roadmap contains three key components: the product vision, product roadmap, and release plan.

> 总之，价值路线图包含三个关键组件:产品愿景、产品路线图和发布计划。

These three work together to help an Agile team reach its goals through multiple iterations.

> 这三者一起工作，帮助敏捷团队通过多次迭代达到目标。

A value roadmap only works if the team is collaborative and all stakeholders work together regularly.

> 价值路线图只有在团队协作且所有涉众定期一起工作的情况下才有效。

This will ensure that the project achieves results that aligned with the Agile values and principles.

> 这将确保项目实现与敏捷价值和原则相一致的结果。

Awesome.

Now you know how to create a value roadmap.

In the next video, I'll share some tips that will help you create an effective value roadmap.

> 在下一个视频中，我将分享一些帮助您创建有效价值路线图的技巧。



## Product roadmaps: Benefits, pitfalls-隐患,陷阱, and best practices

> 产品路线图:好处、缺陷和最佳实践

As you learned in the previous video, roadmaps are an important part of any long-running project.

> 正如您在上一个视频中了解到的，路线图是任何长期运行项目的重要组成部分。

In this reading, we will summarize the benefits of and best practices for developing a product roadmap, as well as highlight some of the pitfalls you might encounter-遭遇,邂逅. 

> 在本文中，我们将总结开发产品路线图的好处和最佳实践，并强调您可能遇到的一些陷阱。

You may see different types of roadmaps as you continue your project management career.

> 当你继续你的项目管理生涯时，你可能会看到不同类型的路线图。

Each team or company may interpret-解释,说明,口译 the roadmap slightly-稍微,轻微地 differently.

> 每个团队或公司对路线图的理解可能略有不同。

Here are some of the various types:

> 下面是一些不同类型的:

- Project roadmap
- Product roadmap
- Value roadmap
- Lean roadmap
- Agile roadmap

Roadmaps are often represented visually and many try to fit the roadmap on one page so that reviewers can notice the big picture of the product timeline.

> 路线图通常是可视化的，许多人试图把路线图放在一页纸上，这样审阅者就可以注意到产品时间表的大局。

![Graphic of sample roadmap with horizontal bars representing tasks over four quarters](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_RevuwqpSXKXr7sKqVlyNA_d4f7d28e5f614255ab23e64fc563fba5_Screen-Shot-2021-02-01-at-9.35.20-PM.png?expiry=1704672000000&hmac=GNrnxi6UtpWO1_sTa5pezB45Gcgg4CKV17-Fl6c-fRI)

The **benefits** of developing and maintaining a product roadmap are numerous-众多的,许多的:

> 开发和维护产品路线图的好处有很多:

- Clarifying the sequence of deliverables 

	> 明确可交付成果的顺序

- Showing teams how their efforts relate to the north-star vision. In other words, their ultimate goal. 

	> 向团队展示他们的努力与北极星愿景的关系。换句话说，就是他们的终极目标。

- Showing stakeholders the incremental value that will be achieved over the course of the project (rather than reviewing it as one big delivery at the end)

	> 向涉众展示将在项目过程中实现的增量价值(而不是在最后将其作为一个大交付进行审查)

- Helping stakeholders roughly-粗略地,大约 understand the layout of the work behind the deliverable

	> 粗略地帮助利益相关者理解可交付成果背后的工作布局

There are also some **pitfalls** around roadmaps to avoid:

> 路线图也有一些需要避免的“陷阱”:

- Letting stakeholders think the roadmap is set and unchangeable. This may cause stakeholders to impede-妨碍,阻碍 teams’ ability to adapt in response to new information, as well as put a lot of pressure-压力 on teams to achieve deadlines no matter what it takes.

	> 让利益相关者认为路线图是确定的，不可改变的。这可能会导致涉众阻碍团队适应新信息的能力，并给团队带来很大的压力，无论如何都要完成最后期限。

- Spending too much time fine-tuning delivery dates versus keeping them rough-粗略的,大致的 and improving specificity-特征,专一性 as the dates get closer

	> 花太多时间微调交付日期，而不是让交付日期保持粗略，并随着日期的临近而提高具体程度

- Putting all the work into creating the roadmap rather than producing the deliverables 

	> 把所有的工作都投入到创建路线图上，而不是生产可交付成果

Here are some **best practices** to help you get the most from your roadmaps:

> 以下是一些**最佳实践**，可以帮助你从路线图中获得最大收益:

- Make it highly noticeable to the team and refer to it frequently.

	> 让它在团队中非常显眼，并经常被提及。

- Clearly indicate-指示,指出 the highest priority items.

	> 明确指出最优先的项目。

- If possible, clearly indicate the highest value items.

	> 如果可能的话，清楚地指出最高价值的项目。

- Make it visible to your wider stakeholder group so that they can use it for their planning. 

	> 让它对更广泛的利益相关者群体可见，这样他们就可以在计划中使用它。

- Conduct regular reviews of the roadmap with sponsors, stakeholders, and the team to ensure that it is still providing the blueprint for the project.

	> 与发起人、涉众和团队一起对路线图进行定期审查，以确保它仍然为项目提供蓝图。

To learn more about some best practices for building product roadmaps, check out this article: [Product Roadmap First Principles](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/product-roadmap-first-principles-empower-scrum-teams-align-w-stakeholders)

> 要了解更多关于构建产品路线图的最佳实践，请查看这篇文章:[产品路线图第一原则](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/product-roadmap-first-principles-empower-scrum-teams-align-w-stakeholders)

**Key takeaway**

Roadmaps are important for any well-managed project, but they are especially useful to Agile teams.

> 路线图对于任何管理良好的项目都很重要，但它们对敏捷团队尤其有用。

Having a shared roadmap about what the team is delivering over a longer time period is an important way to connect the work that the team does on the sprints with the broader vision for the project.

> 拥有一个关于团队在较长时间内交付的内容的共享路线图是将团队在sprint中所做的工作与项目的更广泛愿景联系起来的重要方法。

This helps the team stay motivated through the rough patches-补丁 and leads to a great sense of accomplishment-成就,成绩 as roadmap deliverables are achieved. 

> 这有助于团队在粗糙的补丁中保持动力，并在实现路线图可交付成果时产生巨大的成就感。



## Creating an effective value roadmap

> 创建有效的价值路线图

Hi again.

In the previous video, I introduced you to the concept of a value roadmap and described its three main components.

> 在上一个视频中，我向您介绍了价值路线图的概念，并描述了它的三个主要组成部分。

product vision, product roadmap, and release plans.

> 产品远景、产品路线图和发布计划。

A value roadmap helps you determine specific routes for your team to deliver the most value.

> 价值路线图可以帮助您确定团队交付最大价值的具体路线。

It uses the basic events of Scrum to define product goals and requirements so the team can deliver a successful final product.

> 它使用Scrum的基本事件来定义产品目标和需求，以便团队能够交付成功的最终产品。

In this video, I'll share some tips for creating an effective value roadmap.

> 在这个视频中，我将分享一些创建有效价值路线图的技巧。

---

My first tip is about creating the product roadmap.

> 我的第一个技巧是关于创建产品路线图。

The product roadmap provides a high level view of the expected product, its requirements and an estimated timeline for reaching milestones.

> 产品路线图提供了预期产品、其需求和达到里程碑的估计时间表的高层次视图。

Many of those milestones will be product release dates.

> 其中许多里程碑将是产品发布日期。

You'll need to ensure that product release dates are only rough estimates.

> 你需要确保产品发布日期只是粗略的估计。

This is because as an Agile team, you know, that things can and do change.

> 这是因为作为一个敏捷团队，你知道，事情可以而且确实会发生变化。

This is especially true since these dates could be anywhere from several months to several years down the road.

> 这一点尤其正确，因为这些日期可能是几个月到几年之后的任何地方。

If the roadmap is too specific, it might set the team up for failure because the dates can't be guaranteed-保证,担保.

> 如果路线图过于具体，可能会导致团队失败，因为无法保证日期。

---

Speaking of product release dates, this leads me to my next tip, which is about the release plans.

> 说到产品发布日期，这就引出了我的下一个技巧，即发布计划。

There are some important things to know about creating a release plan which includes approximate target release dates.

> 关于创建包含大致目标发布日期的发布计划，有一些重要的事情需要了解。

It's very important that the Product Owner and Project Manager or Scrum Master work together to develop each release plan. 

> 产品负责人和项目经理或Scrum Master一起制定每个发布计划是非常重要的。

This is because the release plans need to connect the product roadmap with the team's capacity and velocity.

> 这是因为发布计划需要将产品路线图与团队的能力和速度联系起来。

The capacity and velocity is the measure of the team's ability to complete work at a certain pace.

> 能力和速度是衡量团队以一定速度完成工作的能力。

A release plan that isn't connected to the team's ability to complete work could be unrealistic and lead to an unsustainable-无法持续的,不可持续的 pace for the team.

> 与团队完成工作的能力无关的发布计划可能是不现实的，并导致团队的不可持续的步伐。

This would violate-违反,违背 one of our Agile principles, which states Agile processes, promote sustainable-可持续的,持续性的 development.

> 这将违反我们的敏捷原则之一，即敏捷过程促进可持续开发。

The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely-无限期地.

> 发起人、开发人员和用户应该能够无限期地保持恒定的速度。

If there are any hard dates or deadlines on your roadmap, meaning a date that cannot change, factor these into any release plans that might be affected.

> 如果您的路线图上有任何硬性日期或截止日期，即不能更改的日期，请将其纳入可能受影响的任何发布计划中。

For example, Virtual Verde might realize that Office Green has an office décor-装饰品 convention in October, and they want to launch the first phase of Virtual Verde services at that event.

> 例如，Virtual Verde可能意识到Office Green在10月份有一个办公室会议，他们希望在该会议上启动Virtual Verde服务的第一阶段。

Communicate hard deadlines with your stakeholders, so there's a clear understanding of must have features.

> 与你的利益相关者沟通严格的截止日期，这样就能清楚地了解必须具备的功能。

This way, if the team discovers it might be at risk for not meeting the deadlines, they can quickly focus on the must have features. 

> 这样，如果团队发现有可能赶不上最后期限，他们就可以迅速关注必须具备的特性。

Since Agile is all about embracing-拥抱,欣然接受 and anticipating-预期,预料 change, it might seem like having a release plan goes against the actual value of responding to change over following a plan.

> 由于敏捷是关于拥抱和预测变化的，所以看起来有一个发布计划与响应变化的实际价值相违背，而不是遵循计划。

But having a release plan does not mean you are resistant-抵制的,反抗的 to change.

> 但是有一个发布计划并不意味着你抵制改变。

And Agile team treats a release plan as a living artifact.

> 敏捷团队将发布计划视为一个活的工件。

So the plan can change based on the environment and new information that's received.

> 所以计划可以根据环境和接收到的新信息而改变。

Some common factors that may result in a change to the release plan could include a change in team velocity, or how much work the team can do in a given iteration or Sprint.

> 可能导致发布计划变更的一些常见因素可能包括团队速度的变更，或者团队在给定的迭代或Sprint中可以完成多少工作。

This could be from adding or losing team members or even just efficiency gains from how they work.

> 这可能是通过增加或减少团队成员，甚至只是通过他们的工作方式提高效率。

A second factor is a change to the product scope.

> 第二个因素是产品范围的变化。

If the Product Owner approves the change to the product.

> 如果产品负责人批准了对产品的更改。

And a third factor that could affect a release plan, is improving the understanding of how much effort is needed to build certain features.

> 第三个可能影响发布计划的因素，是提高对构建某些特性需要多少努力的理解。

The team may discover that a user story or epic is more or less difficult than they originally thought, after doing some research or simply from better understanding the product space.

> 团队可能会发现，在做了一些研究或仅仅是更好地了解产品空间之后，用户故事或史诗比他们最初想象的或多或少困难。

My last tip for creating an effective value roadmap is that the Scrum Master or Project Manager should always review the release plan before starting a Sprint planning session.

> 关于创建有效的价值路线图，我的最后一个建议是，Scrum主管或项目经理应该在开始Sprint计划会议之前始终检查发布计划。

They review the release plan to check whether the team is on track.

> 他们审查发布计划以检查团队是否在正轨上。

If the team is off track, the Scrum Master needs to have an open conversation with the Product Owner and business people to figure out what they can adjust to get back on track.

> 如果团队偏离了轨道，Scrum Master需要与产品负责人和业务人员进行一次公开的对话，找出他们可以做出哪些调整来回到正轨。

This is where the Scrum Value of transparency is key.

> 这就是透明度的Scrum价值的关键所在。

An effective value roadmap is a powerful tool for building and delivering successful products.

> 有效的价值路线图是构建和交付成功产品的强大工具。

The plans you create will help you stay focused on delivering maximum value and the ability to remain flexible and stay Agile.

> 您创建的计划将帮助您专注于交付最大价值，并保持灵活性和敏捷性。

---

In the next set of videos, we're going to switch gears-排挡,齿轮 and discuss some common challenges that you might encounter-遭遇,偶遇 when introducing Agile and Scrum, or when joining an organization that is transitioning-过渡,转变 to Agile.

> 在下一组视频中，我们将切换话题，讨论在介绍敏捷和Scrum时，或者在加入一个正在向敏捷过渡的组织时可能遇到的一些常见挑战。

I'll share some tips for how you, as the project manager can help support and coach your team **along the way**-一路上,沿途.

> 我将分享一些建议，告诉作为项目经理的您如何在此过程中帮助支持和指导您的团队。

Meet you there.



## Responding to change over following a plan

 >对变化做出反应，而不是遵循计划

As we learned in the beginning of this course, Agile dedicates-致力于,献身于 one of its four values to “Responding to change over following a plan.”

> 正如我们在本课程开始时所学到的，敏捷将其四个价值观之一奉献给“响应变化而不是遵循计划”。

This reading aims to clarify some important considerations when implementing a change to the release plan.

> 这篇文章的目的是澄清在对发布计划实施变更时需要考虑的一些重要事项。

The best way to think about changing your plan is to break it down into three stages:

> 考虑改变你的计划的最好方法是把它分成三个阶段:

1. Identifying a needed change 

	> 确定需要的更改

2. Deciding to make the change

	> 决定做出改变

3. Implementing the change

	> 实现变更

**Step 1: Identifying a needed change** 

> 步骤1:确定需要的更改

First, how do you know if your plan needs to be changed?

> 首先，你如何知道你的计划是否需要改变?

Here are some aspects of your project that may be candidates-候选人 for change: scope, time, and costs (or resources).

> 以下是您的项目可能需要更改的一些方面:范围、时间和成本(或资源)。

As we previously learned, these are called the “triple constraint,” and they provide a great framework for evaluating change in Agile and traditional projects.

> 正如我们之前所了解的，这些被称为“三重约束”，它们为评估敏捷和传统项目中的变更提供了一个很好的框架。

- In Agile, **scope** refers to the contents of the product roadmap, the items in the Product Backlog, the intended-打算,想要 deliverables of the project, and the intended users or customers. This is the “what” of the project.

	> 在敏捷中，“范围”指的是产品路线图的内容、产品待办事项列表中的项目、项目的预期可交付成果以及预期的用户或客户。这是项目的“什么”。

- **Time** refers to the elements of time or layout of the deliverables over a period of time. This could include the product roadmap timeline, release schedule, or even the Sprint duration. This is the “when” of the project.

	> **时间**指在一段时间内交付成果的时间或布局要素。这可能包括产品路线图时间表、发布计划，甚至是Sprint持续时间。这是项目的“何时”。

- **Costs** or **resources** refer to the makeup of the Development Team, project managers, and product owners, and other “business people” as well as the equipment-设备,用具 available to create the deliverable. This is the “how” of the project.

	> 成本或资源指的是开发团队、项目经理、产品所有者和其他“业务人员”的组成，以及用于创建可交付成果的可用设备。这就是项目的“如何”。

Agile projects are open to change in any of these three areas, and a needed change could be identified by any project stakeholders, including the Product Owner, Project Manager, Scrum Master, or the Development Team themselves.

> 敏捷项目对这三个领域中的任何一个都是开放的，任何项目干系人都可以确定需要的变更，包括产品负责人、项目经理、Scrum Master或开发团队本身。

Sources of identified changes could include:

> 已识别变化的来源包括:

- Customer feedback on early prototypes results in new features and some deleted features (scope change)

	> 客户对早期原型的反馈产生了新的特性和一些被删除的特性(范围变化)

- Sprint Retrospective identifies an area of understaffing-人员配备不足 (cost or resource change)

	> Sprint回顾确定人员不足的领域(成本或资源变化)

- Critical project dependencies or deliverable dates have shifted, resulting in a change to the project roadmap (schedule or time change)

	> 关键的项目依赖关系或可交付日期发生了变化，导致项目路线图(进度或时间变化)发生了变化。

![A woman scratching her head with a question mark next to her](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Rdmo5UbmQrSZqOVG5gK0vg_a0893ab53f7a45d7b806285bee51f0f1_Copy-of-UX_C2_M1_L6_R4_E-1-.png?expiry=1704672000000&hmac=RuOry16Hi4CH4iBY2oock-sEqOuq92y0CXZWg20kj8E)

**Step 2: Deciding to make the change**

> 第二步:决定做出改变

Next, how do you decide to actually make the change?

> 接下来，您如何决定实际进行更改?

There are many decision-making models available to reference.

> 有许多可供参考的决策模型。

Here are the basic steps involved in most of these models:

> 以下是大多数这些模型涉及的基本步骤:

- **Identify the “decider-决定者,裁决者.”** It is best to have a single person—generally the Product Owner or a senior stakeholder—in the role of decider to ensure consistency and accountability. 

	> **确定“决定者”。**最好让一个人——通常是产品负责人或高级干系人——担任决策者的角色，以确保一致性和问责制。

- **Develop and share what factors are important to the decision**, and gather supporting data that will help the decider make the decision.

	> 开发和分享对决策重要的因素，并收集有助于决策者做出决策的支持数据。

- **Openly discuss the benefits and costs of the decision.** Identify areas of uncertainty and capture assumptions-假定,假设.

	> 公开讨论决策的收益和成本。确定不确定的领域并捕捉假设。

- **Document the decision.**

**Step 3: Implementing the change**

> 步骤3:实现更改

Once changes are approved, it is important to do several things:

> 一旦修改被批准，重要的是要做几件事:

- **Document the change and decision-making process.**  Include meeting notes, pros/cons lists, assumptions, and data that went into making the decision to change the project.

	> **记录变更和决策过程。**包括会议记录、利弊清单、假设和数据，这些都是做出改变项目决定的依据。

- **Capture the change in any affected artifacts**.  Update any roadmaps, Product Backlogs, staffing-人员配置 plans, and integration dates, and include a reference to the source of the change so that stakeholders can refer back to it. Consider using revision-修改,修订 labels or dates on affected documents like “version 1.2” or “updated on December 20th” so that the team can clearly recognize that the document has changed.

	> **捕获任何受影响工件中的更改**。更新任何路线图、产品backlog、人员配备计划和集成日期，并包含对变更源的引用，以便涉众可以引用它。考虑在受影响的文档上使用诸如“版本1.2”或“12月20日更新”之类的修订标签或日期，以便团队可以清楚地识别文档已更改。

- **Share the change with all affected stakeholders.**  You can do this through many types of forums: in person at meetings, in documentation and meeting notes, and through email announcements. 

	> **与所有受影响的利益相关者分享变更。**你可以通过许多类型的论坛来做到这一点:在会议上，在文档和会议记录中，以及通过电子邮件通知。

- **Monitor the change** **for a certain amount of time.**  This ensures that the team is supportive and aware of the change.

	> 在一定时间内监视更改。这确保了团队的支持和对变更的意识。

If the change was not approved during the decision stage, you should still document the information and logic-逻辑 used to make the decision.

> 如果在决策阶段未批准更改，您仍然应该记录用于做出决策的信息和逻辑。

You may even consider putting a change on hold-使保持（在某位置） while you wait for more information to make the decision with higher confidence-自信,信心.

> 你甚至可以考虑暂时搁置改变，等待更多的信息，以更有信心地做出决定。





# Leading through change and challenges

> 领导变革和挑战

> 4 - video、2-reading material

## Facilitating organizational change

> 促进组织变革

Hi there.

In this video, I'm going to discuss your role as a project manager in an organization that wants to implement Agile practices.

> 在这段视频中，我将讨论你作为项目经理在一个想要实施敏捷实践的组织中的角色。

As you conduct your project management job search, you're likely to find many of the organizations you apply to as either already being Agile, making the switch to becoming Agile, or not yet Agile but ready to transition.

> 当你进行项目管理工作搜索时，你可能会发现你申请的许多组织要么已经是敏捷的，正在向敏捷转变，要么还不是敏捷的，但已经准备好转变了。

As an entry level project manager, it's not likely you'll be expected to lead a complete change to Agile in a large organization.

> 作为一个入门级的项目经理，你不太可能被期望在一个大型组织中领导一个完全的敏捷变革。

But you may be expected to help support the change process.

> 但是你可能需要帮助支持变革过程。

On the other hand, you might get hired by a smaller organization that does want you to lead the change.

> 另一方面，你可能会被一个较小的组织雇用，他们确实希望你领导变革。

The techniques I'll share with you in this video will set you up to be prepared for all of these different scenarios.

> 我将在本视频中与您分享的技巧将使您为所有这些不同的场景做好准备。

---

Let's begin.

First, let's review some of the key learnings from one of the earlier courses on organizational culture and change management. 

> 首先，让我们回顾一下早期关于组织文化和变革管理的课程中的一些关键知识。

When an organization shifts the way it conducts business, it usually requires a shift in its culture as well.

> 当一个组织改变其开展业务的方式时，通常也需要改变其文化。

Understanding organizational culture and the change management process is crucial when introducing new ways of working. 

> 在引入新的工作方式时，理解组织文化和变革管理过程是至关重要的。

Organizational culture is based on shared workplace values and **pops up in**-出现在 people's behaviors, activities, the way they communicate, and how they work with each other.

> 组织文化以共同的工作场所价值观为基础，体现在人们的行为、活动、沟通方式以及彼此之间的合作方式中。

A change that's out of sync with the existing culture is much more difficult to complete.

> 与现有文化不同步的变化更难完成。

In fact, there's research-研究,探索 proving-证实,证明 that companies that don't consider the cultural aspects of Agile are more likely to fail.

> 事实上，有研究证明，不考虑敏捷文化方面的公司更有可能失败。

Change management is the process of getting folks to adopt a new product, process, or in Agile's case, a new value system.

> 变更管理是让人们采用新产品、新过程的过程，或者在敏捷的情况下，采用新价值体系的过程。

Let's get into how to help introduce—or continue the adoption of—Agile or Scrum into an organization.

> 让我们来看看如何帮助在组织中引入或继续采用敏捷或Scrum。

Unless the organization has many years of Agile behaviors and experience, you may be facing a change in organizational culture. 

> 除非该组织拥有多年的敏捷行为和经验，否则您可能会面临组织文化的变化。

These changes take time—sometimes-有时,有时候 years—to complete.

> 这些变化需要时间，有时需要数年才能完成。

As a project manager, you might only implement a few changes, and that's okay.

> 作为一名项目经理，你可能只会执行一些更改，但这没有关系。

You'll still be adding value by demonstrating to your team or organization new and different ways of approaching-对付,处理 their business.

> 通过向你的团队或组织展示处理业务的新方法，你仍然可以增加价值。

I'll share with you some words of wisdom-智慧,知识 I heard from a colleague-同事,同僚many years ago.

> 多年前，我从一位同事那里听到一些至理名言，与大家分享。

They said, "Change takes patient-能忍耐的,有耐心的 persistence-坚持不懈."

> 他们说:“改变需要耐心和坚持。”

It may feel like things are taking too long, but in many cases, small changes add up to a big change in the long run.

> 这可能会让人觉得事情花了太长时间，但在许多情况下，从长远来看，小的变化会带来大的变化。

---

What are some ways that you can bring Agile or Scrum to a new team?

> 有哪些方法可以将敏捷或Scrum引入新团队?

First, I want you to think about the concept of creating a sense of ownership and urgency.

> 首先，我想让你们思考一下创造一种主人翁感和紧迫感的概念。

When people feel a sense of ownership and urgency around a project, it increases interest, motivation, and engagement-参加,从事 with the project outcome.

> 当人们对项目有一种所有权和紧迫感时，就会增加对项目结果的兴趣、动力和参与。

One way to create a sense of ownership is to find an executive sponsor who also feels a sense of ownership for the change you're creating.

> 创造主人翁感的一种方法是找到一个对你所创造的改变也有主人翁感的执行发起人。

Wherever possible, point out connections between the changes you're making and the company's stated mission or values. 

> 只要有可能，指出你所做的改变与公司的既定使命或价值观之间的联系。

Having buy-in from someone at the top increases your chances of successfully driving any change in organizational culture. 

> 获得高层的支持会增加你成功推动组织文化变革的机会。

Ideally, your sponsor will reinforce-加强,增强,强化,增援 the benefits of Agile to the organization and give you the support and resources you need. 

> 理想情况下，您的发起人将向组织强调敏捷的好处，并为您提供所需的支持和资源。

What about creating a sense of urgency-紧急,迫切?

> 创造一种紧迫感怎么样?

My favorite approach to this is to ask the team, the organization, and the stakeholders questions about what's working and what's not working right now.

> 对此，我最喜欢的方法是向团队、组织和涉众询问目前哪些工作可行，哪些工作不可行。

Then I ensure the changes relate directly-直接地 to those opportunities.

> 然后我确保这些变化与这些机会直接相关。

Here are some questions you could try.

> 这里有一些问题你可以试试。

What is preventing us from providing the best possible product to our customers?

> 是什么阻碍了我们向客户提供最好的产品?

What is allowing our competitors-竞争者,对手 to outperform-胜过,做得比…好 us in this market?

> 是什么让我们的竞争对手在这个市场上超越我们?

How can we help our teams become more productive and supported in their work?

> 我们如何帮助我们的团队在工作中变得更有效率和更受支持?

This not only helps you prioritize your work, you get the team thinking about the possibilities-可能性 they'll enjoy if the change is successful.

> 这不仅可以帮助你确定工作的优先级，还可以让团队考虑如果改变成功，他们将享受的可能性。

You can use these questions going forward-向前 to collect feedback during the change.

> 您可以使用这些问题来收集更改期间的反馈。

Coming back to these questions and demonstrating the incremental-增量 improvements is the true spirit-精神 of Agile.

> 回到这些问题并展示增量改进才是真正的敏捷精神。

---

Let's come back to our friends at Virtual Verde.

> 让我们回到Virtual Verde的朋友身上。

When the team set out to create this Agile project and change towards an Agile approach, they realized that the CEO of Office Green wanted to make sure they took advantage-有利条件,优势 of the market trends since more people were moving to home offices.

> 当团队开始创建这个敏捷项目并转向敏捷方法时，他们意识到Office Green的首席执行官希望确保他们利用市场趋势，因为越来越多的人搬到家庭办公室。

They created a sense of urgency by highlighting that home office decorating-装修,装饰 was becoming a hot online trend, and they wanted Office Green to become a part of the action.

> 他们通过强调家庭办公室装修正在成为网上的热门趋势，创造了一种紧迫感，他们希望办公室绿色成为行动的一部分。

Lastly, the Virtual Verde team had lots of experience from their Plant Pals project, so they could gather a team who was motivated to apply what they learned and try a different approach to a new market opportunity.

> 最后，Virtual Verde团队在《Plant Pals》项目中积累了丰富的经验，因此他们可以组建一支有动力的团队，将他们所学到的知识应用到新的市场机会中，并尝试不同的方法。

Bringing Agile or Scrum to a new team could be challenging but well worth the effort.

> 将敏捷或Scrum引入新团队可能具有挑战性，但值得付出努力。

By applying some of these techniques, you will increase your chances of success.

> 通过运用这些技巧，你将增加成功的机会。

I've found that with a little patient-能忍耐的,有耐心的 persistence-坚持不懈, you can get past some of the initial skepticism-怀疑态度, and the benefits of an Agile approach will start to become obvious-明显的,显然的 to the team.

> 我发现，只要有一点耐心的坚持，您就可以克服最初的一些怀疑，敏捷方法的好处将开始对团队变得明显。

Once this happens, change will become easier to drive over time with their commitments.

> 一旦发生这种情况，随着时间的推移，他们的承诺将更容易推动变革。

I once had a large global team at Google of about 200 developers.

> 我曾经在谷歌有一个庞大的全球团队，大约有200名开发人员。

My director and I wanted to transform them into an Agile organization.

> 我的主管和我想把他们转变成一个敏捷组织。

It took us about two years and many trips to different work sites for me and my team of project managers to deliver the tools, processes, and coaching to bring the team up to speed on an Agile way of working.

> 我和我的项目经理团队花了大约两年的时间，多次前往不同的工作地点，交付工具、流程和指导，以使团队加快敏捷工作方式的速度。

I approached-接近 that transformation very much like how I described here, and it worked.

> 我接近这种转变就像我在这里描述的那样，它起作用了。

In the next video, I'll share some tips for coaching new and developing Agile teams.

> 在下一个视频中，我将分享一些指导新开发敏捷团队的技巧。

Meet you there.



## The influencer-有影响力者,有影响力的人 change framework

> 影响者改变框架

In the previous video, we learned how to apply organizational change management techniques to your team in Agile or Scrum.

> 在之前的视频中，我们学习了如何将组织变革管理技术应用到敏捷或Scrum团队中。

In this reading, we will learn about the influencer **change framework** developed by Joseph Grenny, Kerry Patterson, David Maxfield, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler in the book *INFLUENCER: The New Science of Leading Change*, which explores the power of influence in facilitating organizational change. 

> 在这篇阅读中，我们将学习Joseph Grenny、Kerry Patterson、David Maxfield、Ron McMillan和Al Switzler在《影响者:领导变革的新科学》一书中提出的影响者变革框架，这本书探讨了影响在促进组织变革中的力量。

**What does it mean to be an influencer?** 

> 成为影响者意味着什么?

These days, when we hear the word **influencer**, some might think of social-社会的 media stardom-明星界,明星身份.

> 如今，当我们听到“影响者”这个词时，有些人可能会想到社交媒体明星。

But being an influencer is bigger than getting “likes”—it is about someone’s ability to lead and influence others to change their behaviors, hearts-心, and minds to produce meaningful-有意义的,重要的, sustainable-可持续的,持续性的 results.

> 但是，成为一个有影响力的人不仅仅是获得“赞”——这是一个人领导和影响他人的能力，改变他们的行为、心灵和思想，从而产生有意义的、可持续的结果。

As a project manager, you will be asked to lead efforts that require this level of change, and applying this model can lead to a big impact.

> 作为一名项目经理，您将被要求领导需要这种级别的变更的工作，并且应用此模型可以产生很大的影响。

To influence is different than to persuade-说服,劝服.

> 影响不同于说服。

Persuasion-说服,劝服,说服力 is short-term, while influence is lasting-持久的,耐久的.

> 说服是短暂的，而影响是持久的。

In order to have real influence, you need others to trust you, consider you an authority, and have confidence in your decisions.

> 为了有真正的影响力，你需要别人信任你，把你当作权威，对你的决定有信心。

As a project manager in Agile projects, you may use influence to facilitate organizational change or to get a team to try a new tool, process, or technology.

> 作为敏捷项目的项目经理，您可以使用影响力来促进组织变革，或者让团队尝试新的工具、过程或技术。

When facilitating organizational change, influence is the difference between temporary changes in behavior and deep change in culture and values.

> 在促进组织变革时，影响是行为上的暂时改变与文化和价值观上的深刻改变之间的区别。

---

**Three keys to influence** 

> 影响的三个关键

The three keys to influence, as researched by the authors of this model, are to clarify measurable results, find vital-至关重要的,必不可少的 behaviors, and use the six sources of influence.

> 正如这个模型的作者所研究的，影响的三个关键是：澄清可测量的结果，发现重要的行为，以及使用六个影响来源。

Let’s break each of these down.

**Clarify measurable results**

> 明确可测量的结果

You can’t influence others to change until you know what you want, why you want it, and when you want it.

> 除非你知道自己想要什么，为什么想要，什么时候想要，否则你无法影响别人去改变。

You may recall that effective results are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (S.M.A.R.T).

> 您可能还记得，有效的结果是具体的、可测量的、可实现的、相关的和有时限的(S.M.A.R.T)。

When setting goals for a project, remember to ask yourself what the “why” entails-使必要,需要.

> 当为一个项目设定目标时，记得问自己“为什么”需要什么。

Are the results specific and measurable?

> 结果是否具体且可衡量?

Is it what you intended-打算,想要?

> 这是你想要的吗?

Is it time-bound?

Also, make sure the measures are visible and transparent to the entire team throughout the change.

> 此外，要确保在整个变更过程中，度量对整个团队都是可见和透明的。



**Find vital behaviors** 

> 发现重要的行为

A **vital behavior** is the action an individual takes at a pivotal-中枢的,关键的 moment in the context of the change they are seeking.

> 一个重要的行为是一个人在寻求改变的关键时刻所采取的行动。

For example, if a member of the Development Team is seeking to increase involvement-参与,介入 of the Product Owner throughout-遍及 the development process, they might exhibit-表现出,展览,展出 a vital behavior when they have just finished mocking up a new feature.

> 例如，如果开发团队的成员试图在整个开发过程中增加产品负责人的参与，那么当他们刚刚完成新功能的模拟时，他们可能会表现出重要的行为。

Instead of just continuing on to the next item on their to-do list, they might send an email to the Product Owner to review their work and provide feedback.

> 他们可能会向产品负责人发送电子邮件，以检查他们的工作并提供反馈，而不是继续他们的待办事项列表上的下一个项目。

By choosing to include or exclude their Product Owner at a pivotal moment, the developer is taking a small action to enact-使发生,付诸实际 the change they want to create.

> 通过在关键时刻选择包括或排除他们的产品负责人，开发人员正在采取一个小行动来实现他们想要创建的更改。

As we have discussed, real change happens when you can change the behaviors of others.

> 正如我们所讨论的，当你能改变他人的行为时，真正的改变就会发生。

Whether you are changing the minds of your team, stakeholders, or customers, it is important to track their current behavior patterns and understand the behaviors you need them to adopt in order to make the change you are seeking. 

> 无论您是在改变团队、利益相关者还是客户的想法，重要的是跟踪他们当前的行为模式，并了解为了实现您所寻求的更改，您需要他们采用的行为。

To determine vital behaviors, you might consult experts, scan the best and most-cited-被引用最多的 articles and research, or perform a culture assessment by identifying norms and customs-风俗,习俗,习惯 within the team.

> 为了确定重要的行为，您可能会咨询专家，浏览最好和被引用最多的文章和研究，或者通过确定团队内部的规范和习俗来进行文化评估。

When identifying the behaviors, evaluate-评价,评估 which behaviors are constructive-建设性的,有助益的 to the change you wish to promote and notice examples of those who succeed where most others fail.

> 当确定行为时，评估哪些行为对你想要促进的改变是有建设性的，并注意那些成功的例子，而大多数人都失败了。



**Use the six sources of influence**

> 运用六大影响力来源

The authors of *INFLUENCER: The New Science of Leading Change* studied companies and individuals who were successful or unsuccessful with implementing change, and they identified six sources or factors that were correlated-相互关联 with successful change. 

> 《影响者:领导变革的新科学》一书的作者研究了成功或不成功实施变革的公司和个人，并确定了与成功变革相关的六个来源或因素。

When determining how to influence your target audience to create change, you should consider using all of these sources to increase your chances of success.

> 当决定如何影响你的目标受众来创造改变时，你应该考虑使用所有这些资源来增加你成功的机会。

You may even consider prioritizing these based on your knowledge-知识,了解 of your audience.

> 你甚至可以考虑根据你对用户的了解来确定优先级。

For example, some target audiences may be most swayed-统治,势力 by financial incentives-激励,刺激, while others may be more incentivized-有奖鼓励,激励 by social justice-公平,正义 impacts. 

> 例如，一些目标受众可能最受财政激励的影响，而另一些目标受众可能更受社会正义影响的影响。

Here are the six sources uncovered-揭露,发现 by the authors in their research, including a sample idea of how you can use these examples in your work in tandem-串联工作组,纵列的,协同地 with our Product Owner involvement-参与,介入 scenario (described earlier): 

> 以下是作者在他们的研究中发现的六个来源，包括如何在我们的产品负责人参与场景(前面描述过)中串联使用这些示例的示例想法:

1. **Personal motivation**: Are the individuals motivated internally-在体内,在内部 to engage in the new behavior? Can you help them “love what they hate”?  *Example*: Ensure the Product Owner is timely-及时的,适时的, appreciative-感激的,感谢的,欣赏的,赞赏的, and effective while giving their feedback. 

	> **个人动机**:个人是否有参与新行为的内在动机?你能帮助他们“爱他们所恨的”吗?*示例*:确保产品负责人在提供反馈时是及时的、感激的和有效的。

2. **Personal ability**: Are the individuals capable-有能力的,有本领的 of performing the behavior? Do they have the ability, knowledge, and skills to “do what they can't”? *Example*: Ensure that the developer knows how to use the available demo tools and can easily send a quick video of the new feature in their email to the Product Owner. 

	> **个人能力**:个人是否有能力执行该行为?他们是否有能力、知识和技能去“做他们不能做的事”?*示例*:确保开发人员知道如何使用可用的演示工具，并且可以轻松地在电子邮件中向产品负责人发送新功能的快速视频。

3. **Social motivation**: Are there social contacts-联系,联络 or networks encouraging or discouraging-劝阻,阻碍 this new behavior?  *Example*: Have the Development Team members remind-提醒,使想起 each other in the Daily Scrum to email the Product Owner before they finalize the work.

	> **社会动机**:社会联系或网络是否鼓励或阻碍这种新行为?*示例*:让开发团队成员在每日Scrum中互相提醒，在完成工作之前给产品负责人发邮件。

4. **Social ability**: Does the team have resources within their social network to help them carry out the new behaviors? *Example*: Give the Development Team a tool to track all of their demos-演示,示范 to the Product Owner during the Sprint. 

	> **社交能力**:团队在其社交网络中是否拥有资源来帮助他们执行新行为?*示例*:在Sprint期间，给开发团队一个工具来跟踪他们向产品负责人提供的所有演示。

5. **Structural motivation**: Are there rewards-奖励 or incentives-激励,刺激 that they will receive if they perform the new behaviors?  *Example*: Provide a coffee gift card Sprint award that the Product Owner gets to award after each Sprint.

	> **结构性动机**:如果他们执行新行为，他们是否会得到奖励或激励?*示例*:提供一个咖啡礼品卡Sprint奖励，产品负责人可以在每次Sprint后获得奖励。

6. **Structural ability**: Are there environmental factors at play that either deter-使打消念头,防止 or support the new behavior? Can you make the incorrect behavior harder to do than the correct behavior? *Example*: Add a rule to the content management system that **pre-populates**-预填充 the name of the Product Owner in the reviewer list. 

	> **结构能力**:是否存在阻碍或支持新行为的环境因素?你能让错误的行为比正确的行为更难做到吗?*示例*:向内容管理系统添加一条规则，该规则在审阅者列表中预填充Product Owner的名称。

**Key takeaway**

These three keys to influence make up the influencer change framework and will improve your chances of success with a change. 

> 这三个影响的关键组成了影响者改变框架，将提高你成功改变的机会。

Clarify measurable results, find vital behaviors, and leverage-影响力,手段 six sources of influence in tandem-串联,纵列的,协同地 to lead an organization, team, or an individual to experience positive change. 

> 明确可衡量的结果，找到重要的行为，同时利用六种影响力来源来领导组织、团队或个人经历积极的变化。

## Coaching an Agile team

> 指导敏捷团队

Hi again.

As the project manager or Scrum Master, you're in the position-职责 to help the team improve.

> 作为项目经理或Scrum Master，你的职责是帮助团队改进。

In other words, you're the designated-任命,指定 Agile coach.

> 换句话说，您是指定的敏捷教练。

You're there to help the team recognize areas for improvement and help them implement solutions.

> 你要帮助团队认识到需要改进的地方，并帮助他们实现解决方案。

---

In this video, I'm going to break down your role as a coach into three steps, similar to how you might approach being a coach for a sports team.

> 在这个视频中，我将把你作为一个教练的角色分成三个步骤，类似于你如何成为一个运动队的教练。

First, you'll design the "plays" with the team.

> 首先，你将与团队一起设计“玩法”。

Second, you'll provide feedback to the team.

> 其次，你要向团队提供反馈。

Lastly, you'll celebrate and learn with the team.

> 最后，你将与团队一起庆祝和学习。

Let me elaborate-详细说明,详尽阐述 on each area a bit more.

> 让我再详细说明一下每个方面。

First, the Scrum Master designs the plays.

> 首先，Scrum Master设计玩法。

Although the Scrum Master owns the playbook-剧本, it should be created with the whole team.

> 尽管Scrum Master拥有剧本，但剧本应该由整个团队共同制定。

The playbook should include how the whole team runs a Sprint Review, how the team works day-to-day, and how the team publishes plans to stakeholders.

> 剧本应该包括整个团队如何运行Sprint Review，团队如何日常工作，以及团队如何向涉众发布计划。

When updates are needed to the team's plays, it's important that you involve-参加,加入 the team in any decisions.

> 当需要更新球队的战术时，重要的是你要让球队参与到任何决策中来。

Take them through new processes together, think through all the positions on the team, and make sure everyone notices the flow.

> 让他们一起经历新的流程，考虑团队中的所有职位，并确保每个人都注意到流程。

A personal example of this was when I facilitated a brainstorm meeting with my team to discuss which parts of our process weren't working.

> 我个人的一个例子是，我与我的团队进行了一次头脑风暴会议，讨论我们流程的哪些部分不起作用。

We used sticky notes to organize our ideas for improvement and then prioritized the ideas to implement changes.

> 我们使用便利贴来组织我们的改进想法，然后对这些想法进行优先级排序，以实现更改。

---

Second, is provide feedback.

> 第二，提供反馈。

You should always provide feedback to your team and stakeholders as early as possible and on a day-to-day basis.

> 你应该尽可能早地向你的团队和利益相关者提供反馈。

Just like a coach gives directions from the sidelines-场边, the Scrum Master needs to provide guidance all the time.

> 就像教练在场边给出指示一样，Scrum Master需要一直提供指导。

**In addition to**-除了…之外 feedback provided in the moment, the Scrum Master also takes in a big picture view.

> 除了当前提供的反馈，Scrum Master还会有一个大的视角。

This is similar to how a coach might watch a video recap of the game to find patterns that need improvement or plays that worked so well, they should do it every game.

> 这类似于教练观看比赛的视频回顾，以找到需要改进的模式，或者找到非常有效的战术，他们应该每场比赛都这样做。

Providing feedback shouldn't only be about fixing broken things, but finding processes and activities that worked really well and encourage the team to continue using the things that work.

> 提供反馈不应该仅仅是修复损坏的东西，还应该找到运行良好的过程和活动，并鼓励团队继续使用有效的东西。

---

Third, celebrate and learn.

> 第三，庆祝和学习。

Congratulate the team often on a job well done, a happy customer, or a big solution launch.

> 经常祝贺团队完成了一项出色的工作，一个快乐的客户，或者一个大的解决方案的发布。

If the team "loses," meaning they weren't successful in fulfilling a requirement, acknowledge that loss as critical data that will help the team improve next time.

> 如果团队“失败了”，意味着他们没有成功地满足需求，那么承认失败是帮助团队下次改进的关键数据。

It's important for the team to still feel positive about any disappointment-失望,沮丧 and think of it as a learning opportunity.

> 对于团队来说，对任何失望都保持积极的态度并将其视为学习的机会是很重要的。

As Thomas Edison famously said, "I have not failed—I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."

> 正如托马斯·爱迪生的名言:“我没有失败——我只是发现了1万种行不通的方法。”

As a Scrum Master or Agile project manager, you play an essential role in the team and you're a big part of why Scrum and Agile work at all.

> 作为Scrum Master或敏捷项目经理，你在团队中扮演着重要的角色，你是Scrum和敏捷工作的重要组成部分。

You're responsible for ensuring the team is always improving and becoming the best team it can possibly be.

> 你有责任确保团队不断进步，尽可能成为最好的团队。

---

Awesome-让人惊叹的,非常棒的.

Now you know the three steps of coaching your team: designing the plays with the team, providing feedback to the team, and celebrating and learning with the team.

> 现在你知道了指导团队的三个步骤:与团队一起设计战术，向团队提供反馈，以及与团队一起庆祝和学习。

Next up, we'll learn how to anticipate-预期,预料,预见 and respond to real-world risks with Agile and Scrum implementations.

> 接下来，我们将学习如何使用敏捷和Scrum实现来预测和响应现实世界的风险。

Meet you there.



## Coaching versus managing in Agile

> 敏捷中的教练vs管理

In the previous video, we learned about the importance of an Agile coach.

> 在之前的视频中，我们了解了敏捷教练的重要性。

In this reading, we will further explore the work of a coach and how it differs from that of a manager. 

> 在这篇阅读中，我们将进一步探讨教练的工作以及它与经理的工作有何不同。

Both managing and coaching play important roles in project management.

> 管理和指导在项目管理中都扮演着重要的角色。

The difference in each approach is in communication.

> 每种方法的区别在于沟通。

Management is about giving direction-指导, while coaching is about teaching-教导.

> 管理是给予指导，而教练是教导。

Some situations will call for coaching, and others will call for management.

> 有些情况需要指导，有些情况需要管理。

As a project manager, it is important that you understand when each skill set is necessary for success. 

> 作为一个项目经理，重要的是你要了解什么时候每种技能是成功所必需的。

---

**Managing**

So far, we have focused on the responsibilities of project managers.

> 到目前为止，我们关注的是项目经理的职责。

We know that project managers are tasked with delivering a project objective and solving problems as they arise-产生,出现.

> 我们知道，项目经理的任务是交付项目目标并在出现问题时解决问题。

Project managers keep team members organized and on track.

> 项目经理使团队成员保持组织有序，按部就班。

They streamline communication and give directions-指示,说明.

> 他们简化沟通并给出指示。

This is very indicative-指示的,表明的,象征的 of a traditional management approach.

> 这是一种传统的管理方式。

At its core, managing requires overseeing the work of others and can include: 

> 管理的核心是监督他人的工作，可以包括:

- Onboarding and orienting new employees

	> 新员工入职培训

- Conducting meetings

	> 主持会议

- Delegating-授权,把…委托给 tasks and assignments

	> 委派任务和分配

- Monitoring progress and performance against-以…为背景 those tasks

	> 根据这些任务监视进度和性能

- Making high-level decisions

	> 做高层决策

In Agile project management, however, teams are designed to be self-managing.

> 然而，在敏捷项目管理中，团队被设计为自我管理。

A self-managing team has the autonomy to choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others from the top down.

> 一个自我管理的团队有自主选择如何最好地完成他们的工作，而不是由别人自上而下地指导。

Agile team members should also feel empowered and equipped to problem-solve on their own.

> 敏捷团队成员也应该感到自己被授权并有能力解决问题。

Even so, there are some cases where the decisive action of a manager is required.

> 即便如此，在某些情况下，还是需要管理者采取果断行动。

Examples include if there is an emergency-突发事件,紧急情况 that needs immediate action, if you are behind on a deadline, or if a client has very specific needs and you are the most familiar with them.

> 例如，如果有紧急情况需要立即采取行动，如果你落后于最后期限，或者如果客户有非常具体的需求，而你最熟悉他们。

In a results-driven project with little room for error, someone needs to step in and take the lead.

> 在一个结果驱动的项目中，几乎没有犯错的余地，需要有人介入并发挥领导作用。

That is where a managing approach comes in. 

> 这就是管理方法发挥作用的地方。

---

**Coaching**

Although managing seems inherent-内在的,固有的 to project management, coaching is also an important part of the project management role. 

> 虽然管理似乎是项目管理的固有内容，但指导也是项目管理角色的重要组成部分。

Coaching is a two-way communication style aimed at influencing and developing team members’ skills, motivation, and judgment.

> 教练是一种双向沟通方式，旨在影响和发展团队成员的技能、动机和判断力。

Coaching empowers team members to arrive at solutions on their own by teaching them critical-批判的 thinking and decision-making skills.

> 教练通过教会团队成员批判性思维和决策技能，使他们能够自己找到解决方案。

This is achieved through offering feedback and providing opportunities for professional development-成长,发展,开发.

> 这是通过提供反馈和提供专业发展机会来实现的。

When challenges arise, coaches will offer guidance, then get out of the way.

> 当挑战出现时，教练会提供指导，然后让开。

Coaches don’t jump in during times of crisis-危机,紧要关头 in a way that a manager would.

> 教练不会像经理那样在危机时刻挺身而出。

Coaches ask questions to help team members arrive at conclusions-结论,推论 on their own. 

> 教练提出问题是为了帮助团队成员自己得出结论。

Coaches trust that their team members can make smart decisions, and trust can **go a long way**-对…大有帮助.

> 教练相信他们的团队成员可以做出明智的决定，而信任可以大有帮助。

When team members feel trusted, workplace satisfaction increases, and the quality of work improves. 

> 当团队成员感到被信任时，工作场所的满意度就会提高，工作质量也会提高。

![Image of a project manager as a coach](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/hwegfajDT-WHoH2ow1_lWA_463197e8e7b44c65b0443de77f12a25a_C5M4L2R2.png?expiry=1704844800000&hmac=1yjONyF5rgYMJuAQmKqrRvl9RVepD2nLignMskW87UQ)

It is appropriate-合适的,相称的 to use a coaching approach when a team member already has experience working on similar projects and is working on growing new competencies-能力,本领 or is trying a new approach for the first time.

> 当团队成员已经有类似项目的工作经验，并且正在努力培养新的能力或第一次尝试新的方法时，使用教练方法是合适的。

Coaching is about building confidence and capabilities so that individuals can continuously grow and improve.

> 教练是关于建立信心和能力，使个人能够不断成长和提高。

There are a few principles to keep in mind when coaching: 

> 指导时要牢记以下几点原则:

1. **Motivate**: Coaches motivate team members to take action. They point out the value in others’ work and instill-徐徐滴入,逐渐灌输 within them a sense of pride-自豪 in what they do. 

	> 激励:教练激励团队成员采取行动。他们指出别人工作的价值，并给他们灌输一种对自己工作的自豪感。

2. **Support:** Coaches are an accessible resource for their team to come to when they experience problems or if they have an idea they want their feedback on. 

	> **支持:**当团队遇到问题或有想法需要反馈时，教练是一个可访问的资源。

3. **Encourage and appreciate-欣赏,鉴赏:** When someone on their team is struggling with a heavy workload, a coach will acknowledge and validate the weight of their efforts and assure-使确信,向…保证 them that they are capable of handling the challenges ahead.

	> **鼓励和欣赏:**当团队中有人在繁重的工作中挣扎时，教练会承认并认可他们的努力，并向他们保证他们有能力应对未来的挑战。

Coaching is appropriate in many circumstances-条件,情况,环境, especially when you need to build up the confidence of an individual or a team. 

> 教练在很多情况下都是合适的，尤其是当你需要建立个人或团队的信心时。

The most effective leaders strike a healthy balance between managing and coaching based on the needs of the situation, individual, and project they are leading.

> 最有效的领导者会根据他们所领导的情况、个人和项目的需要，在管理和指导之间取得健康的平衡。

Examples of where coaching would be helpful include when a team member is branching out into using a new technology or discipline that will turbocharge-用涡轮给增压 their career opportunities, when an individual’s behavior is having unintended-无意识的,非计划中的 consequences on the team dynamics that are not readily-轻而易举地,容易地 visible, or if a team is recovering-恢复 from a setback-挫折,阻碍.

> 当一名团队成员正在尝试使用一项新技术或新学科来增加他们的职业机会时，当一个人的行为对团队动态产生了意想不到的后果而不容易看到时，或者当一个团队正在从挫折中恢复过来时，教练就会有所帮助。

Here’s a scenario where a project manager or Scrum Master should step in to coach a team: Imagine a Scrum team has failed to launch a product that meets the customer needs Sprint after Sprint.

> 在这种情况下，项目经理或Scrum Master应该介入指导团队:想象一下，Scrum团队在一个又一个Sprint中未能推出满足客户需求的产品。

The Product Owner continues to communicate to the team that the features are not quite right, and they need to rework the product in the next Sprint or release.

> 产品负责人继续与团队沟通功能不太正确，他们需要在下一个Sprint或版本中重新工作产品。

The team feels deflated-打击,使泄气, and they are showing signs of burnout-精疲力竭 because they keep working on the same three features.

> 团队感到泄气，他们表现出精疲力竭的迹象，因为他们一直致力于相同的三个功能。

Here is a perfect opportunity to do some coaching with the whole team.

> 这是一个与整个团队进行指导的绝佳机会。

Consider bringing them together for a working session and cycle through all three principles of coaching:

> 考虑把他们召集到一起，进行一次工作会议，循环使用所有三个指导原则:

1. **Motivation:** Ask the team to brainstorm positive reasons why the customer is providing this feedback and why it matters to create an excellent end product. 

	> **动机:**要求团队集思广益，找出客户提供反馈的积极原因，以及创造优秀最终产品的重要性。

2. **Support:** Work with the team to capture ideas on how to streamline the customer feedback process, such as a design Sprint with the customer in attendance-出席,提供帮助.

	> **支持:**与团队合作，获取关于如何简化客户反馈流程的想法，例如与客户一起参加设计Sprint。

3. **Encourage and appreciate:** Set up an event where the team celebrates the work they have accomplished so far, and make the event fun and inclusive-包容广阔的,无性别歧视的 for all team members.

	> **鼓励和欣赏:**组织一个活动，让团队庆祝他们迄今为止所完成的工作，让活动对所有团队成员来说都是有趣和包容的。

**Key takeaway** 

Managing and coaching are distinct-不同的,有区别的 leadership approaches that each yield-产生 different results, and both styles require effective communication.

> 管理和指导是截然不同的领导方式，各自产生不同的结果，两种风格都需要有效的沟通。

A managing style typically utilizes one-way communication to assign tasks and give directives-指示,指令.

> 管理风格通常使用单向通信来分配任务和给出指令。

Coaching relies on open communication in both directions to help develop an employee’s or team’s skills, so they can become self-sufficient-自给自足的.

> 教练依靠双向的开放沟通来帮助员工或团队发展技能，这样他们就能自给自足。

Some team members and company cultures will naturally favor-较喜欢,偏袒 one style over another, but both are necessary leadership skills. 

> 有些团队成员和公司文化自然会偏爱其中一种风格，但这两种风格都是必要的领导技能。

As an Agile project manager or Scrum Master, you will use both styles.

That said, in Agile and Scrum, a coaching style is usually the best initial option since it will increase the capabilities of the team, leading to more agility-敏捷,灵活 over time. 

> 也就是说，在敏捷和Scrum中，教练风格通常是最好的初始选择，因为它会增加团队的能力，随着时间的推移会带来更多的敏捷性。

When deciding which approach to use, ask yourself: 

1. What is the desired outcome? 

	> 期望的结果是什么?

2. What is the skill level of the team member who has encountered a problem? 

	> 遇到问题的团队成员的技能水平是什么?

3. What does the situation need now to reach the desired outcomes?

	> 现在的情况需要什么才能达到预期的结果?

## Agile team challenges

> 敏捷团队挑战

Hi there.

In this video, we'll go through some of the challenges you might encounter during a change process that are specific to Agile teams.

> 在这段视频中，我们将介绍敏捷团队在变更过程中可能遇到的一些挑战。

As the project manager or Scrum Master, it's your responsibility to help teams improve how they work and coach them on how to effectively adopt Scrum practices.

> 作为项目经理或Scrum Master，你有责任帮助团队改进他们的工作方式，并指导他们如何有效地采用Scrum实践。

So anticipating-预期,预料 and understanding how to work through common challenges before they happen is super important.

> 因此，在常见的挑战发生之前预测并理解如何解决它们是非常重要的。

Remember the four themes of Agile principles that we discussed in an earlier video?

> 还记得我们在之前的视频中讨论过的敏捷原则的四个主题吗?

To refresh your memory, the themes are: value delivery, business collaboration, team dynamics, and culture and retrospectives.

> 为了刷新您的记忆，主题是:价值交付、业务协作、团队动态、文化和回顾。

In this video, we'll focus on challenges you might encounter with an Agile team that are related to the first three themes.

> 在本视频中，我们将重点关注与前三个主题相关的敏捷团队可能遇到的挑战。

---

The first set of challenges are related to value delivery, which is about making sure the team is delivering working solutions frequently.

> 第一组挑战与价值交付有关，这是关于确保团队频繁地交付工作解决方案。

Some signs that your team is experiencing value delivery issues could include things like the team has started missing expected delivery dates and is taking a lot longer than usual to complete tasks.

> 您的团队正在经历价值交付问题的一些迹象可能包括团队已经开始错过预期的交付日期，并且比平常花费更长的时间来完成任务。

Or you might notice that the team seems burned out, is working long hours, and showing signs of exhaustion-筋疲力尽,耗尽.

> 或者你可能会注意到团队似乎已经筋疲力尽，长时间工作，并且表现出精疲力竭的迹象。

Or maybe the team has too many items in progress at any given time, preventing-阻止,阻碍 tasks from actually getting to done.

> 或者团队在任何给定的时间都有太多的项目在进行中，阻碍了任务的完成。

If you start to notice your team is struggling in these areas, there are a few things you can do to help.

> 如果你开始注意到你的团队在这些方面挣扎，你可以做一些事情来帮助他们。

You can try doing more demos of the solutions with the team to ensure they're delivering on the value roadmap.

> 您可以尝试与团队一起对解决方案进行更多的演示，以确保它们按照价值路线图交付。

When the team pauses to take in a big picture view of the working product, they often notice areas where they can improve and speed up the work.

> 当团队停下来观察工作产品的全貌时，他们通常会注意到可以改进和加快工作的地方。

You can also use retrospectives to ask the team if anything is slowing them down, like waiting on dependencies or communication challenges.

> 您还可以使用回顾来询问团队是否有什么事情拖慢了他们的进度，比如等待依赖项或沟通方面的挑战。

It can also help to do a quick review with the team and make sure that everyone understands what "done" means.

> 与团队一起快速回顾并确保每个人都理解“完成”的含义也会有所帮助。

And finally, be sure to focus on only a few user stories per Sprint.

> 最后，确保每个Sprint只关注几个用户故事。

This ensures the team finishes an item together before moving on.

> 这样可以确保团队在继续工作之前一起完成一个项目。

Putting all this into practice can be harder than you might think.

> 将所有这些付诸实践可能比你想象的要难。

My current team is asked to cover a lot of ground in each Sprint, so it can be tempting for us to try and tackle-应付,解决 too much at once. 

> 我现在的团队被要求在每个Sprint中覆盖很多领域，所以我们可能会试图一次处理太多问题。

But doing that usually just makes everything take longer, so it's not actually helpful.

> 但这样做通常只会让所有事情花费更长时间，所以实际上并没有什么帮助。

It's better to maintain focus and deliver fewer Backlog items in one Sprint than to deliver a lot of items in more Sprints.

> 与其在多个Sprint中交付大量的待办事项，不如在一个Sprint中保持专注并交付较少的待办事项。

---

Okay, another set of challenges you might encounter relate to the business collaboration theme.

> 好的，您可能遇到的另一组挑战与业务协作主题有关。

To recap, business collaboration is about making sure that developers are collaborating with business people on how to build the right product.

> 概括地说，业务协作是关于确保开发人员与业务人员就如何构建正确的产品进行协作。

There are a few common signs that your team might be experiencing business collaboration issues.

> 有一些常见的迹象表明您的团队可能正在经历业务协作问题。

You might notice that the team is overwhelmed-淹没,压垮 with critical feedback or change requests from business people after they reviewed the working solution.

> 您可能会注意到，在审查了工作解决方案之后，团队被来自业务人员的关键反馈或更改请求所淹没。

That could lead to people on your team avoiding asking for feedback or complaining-抱怨,投诉 about requested changes coming from the Product Owner or business team.

> 这可能会导致你的团队成员避免向产品负责人或业务团队寻求反馈或抱怨所要求的更改。

Or you might start to detect-识别,查明,察觉,检测 an "us versus them" mentality-心态,思维方式 between the team doing the work and management.

> 或者，您可能会开始发现在团队和管理层之间存在“我们对他们”的心态。

I've sometimes noticed this manifest-明显的,显而易见的 in negative comments-评论 from team members like, "Don't give a demo to the salesperson. It's not ready yet, and they'll just point out what's wrong."

> 我有时会注意到团队成员的负面评论，比如“不要给销售人员做演示。它还没有准备好，他们只会指出哪里出了问题。”

If you notice any of these signs, there are a few things you can do to help rebuild trust and collaboration between the developers and the business people.

> 如果您注意到这些迹象，您可以做一些事情来帮助重建开发人员和业务人员之间的信任和协作。

To start with, try addressing critical feedback and change requests by doing more demos.

> 首先，尝试通过做更多的演示来解决关键的反馈和变更请求。

This ensures feedback comes in at a steady-持续的,稳定的 pace and that everyone involved has a shared understanding of what done means. 

> 这可以确保反馈以稳定的速度出现，并且每个参与者都对所做的事情有共同的理解。

Next, consider conducting a Solution Design Sprint, which is an entire Sprint spent working solely-单独地,仅有地 on the solution design.

> 接下来，考虑执行一个解决方案设计Sprint，这是一个单独用于解决方案设计的整个Sprint。

These are most effective when the working team and the business people actually sit together and collaborate on the solution. 

> 当工作团队和业务人员真正坐在一起并就解决方案进行协作时，这些是最有效的。

Finally, you can help your team focus by ensuring changes to the Backlog are introduced only in between Sprints.

> 最后，您可以通过确保只在sprint之间引入对Backlog的更改来帮助您的团队集中注意力。

This prevents your team from getting distracted-使分心,使转移注意力 by possible changes which could stress them out and lead to resentment-愤恨,怨恨.

> 这可以防止你的团队被可能的变化分散注意力，这些变化可能会给他们带来压力并导致怨恨。

For example, I was once on a Scrum Team where the engineering director loved to stop by the engineer's desk to ask for a quick dashboard, which is a web page that shows data.

> 例如，我曾经在一个Scrum团队工作，那里的工程总监喜欢在工程师的办公桌前停下来，要求一个快速的仪表板，这是一个显示数据的网页。

Asking the engineer to do this completely-完全地,彻底地 disrupted the team's focus and slowed down the team's velocity.

> 要求工程师这样做完全扰乱了团队的注意力，减慢了团队的速度。

We finally decided to ask the director to come straight-直接的 to the Scrum Master when they needed something so that it could be planned properly and not interrupt the team's current workflow.

> 我们最终决定让主管在需要的时候直接找Scrum Master，这样就可以正确地计划，而不会打断团队当前的工作流程。

---

Okay, let's move on to the third theme: team dynamics and culture.

> 好的，让我们进入第三个主题:团队动力和文化。

Human beings are complex creatures-生物,动物 with lots of different motivations and styles of working, so it's likely that you'll encounter at least a few challenges in this area.

> 人类是复杂的生物，有很多不同的动机和工作风格，所以你很可能在这方面至少会遇到一些挑战。

Here are a few common signs of team dynamics and culture issues to watch out for.

> 这里有一些团队动态和文化问题的常见迹象需要注意。

First is low team morale-士气,精神面貌.

> 首先是团队士气低落。

If people are super grumpy-爱抱怨的, irritated-使不耐烦,激怒, or generally in a bad mood-心情, then you might have some underlying-潜在的,表面下的 team dynamics issues to sort out.

> 如果员工非常暴躁、易怒，或者通常心情不好，那么你可能需要解决一些潜在的团队动态问题。

Next, watch out for signs the team is experiencing lots of conflict-冲突,争执.

> 接下来，注意团队正在经历很多冲突的迹象。

If people are arguing a lot and issues aren't getting resolved, the team probably needs some help.

> 如果人们经常争吵，问题得不到解决，团队可能需要一些帮助。

Not everyone is going to get their way.

> 不是每个人都能如愿以偿。

If team members feel resentful-气愤的,憎恨的 or hold onto grudges-怨恨,嫌隙, it'll negatively impact the team's performance.

> 如果团队成员感到怨恨或怀恨在心，这将对团队的表现产生负面影响。

And finally, and this might surprise you, but low conflict can also be a sign that the team is experiencing issues.

> 最后，这可能会让你感到惊讶，但低冲突也可能是团队遇到问题的迹象。

We're usually taught to believe that no conflict is a good thing, right?

> 我们通常被教导相信没有冲突是件好事，对吧?

But if a team never has disagreements-分歧,争论, it's a sign that they might be worried about starting a conflict because they don't feel like it's a safe environment.

> 但如果一个团队从来没有分歧，这表明他们可能担心引发冲突，因为他们觉得这是一个不安全的环境。

Being open and courageous-勇敢的,有胆量的 are two of our Scrum values, but it's not always easy to put them into practice.

> 开放和勇敢是我们Scrum的两个价值观，但将它们付诸实践并不总是那么容易。

As a project manager, part of your role is helping your team get comfortable being honest with each other and working through-经历,度过 conflicts together.

> 作为一个项目经理，你的部分职责是帮助你的团队变得彼此诚实，一起解决冲突。

If you notice these or any other clear signs of team distress-危难,险情, here are some ideas you can try.

> 如果你注意到这些或任何其他明显的团队困扰迹象，你可以尝试以下一些方法。

You could run a team brainstorm session about how to work better together.

> 你可以组织一个团队头脑风暴会议，讨论如何更好地合作。

Ask the team to identify some areas to improve-改善 on.

> 让团队找出一些需要改进的地方。

An example exercise could involve asking the team to write down stories about the worst-最差的,最糟的 team they've ever worked on and the best team they've ever worked on, then sharing them in a meeting.

> 举个例子，让团队写下他们合作过的最差团队和最好团队的故事，然后在会议上分享。

Then you might have the team create a list of do's and don'ts for working together, based on the stories everyone shared. 

> 然后，您可能会让团队根据每个人分享的故事，创建一个共同工作的“做”和“不做”列表。

Another idea is to change up the workflows.

> 另一个想法是改变工作流程。

Try pairing up people to work together on a hard task or change up the way you run one of your regular meetings.

> 试着把人们配对起来一起完成一项艰巨的任务，或者改变你召开例会的方式。

It can also help to take a training class together or watch a video about team dynamics and discuss it as a group.

> 一起参加培训课程或观看有关团队动态的视频并作为一个小组进行讨论也会有所帮助。

You can also try a retrospective technique from the internet.

> 你也可以尝试从互联网上回溯的技巧。

There are a ton of great resources **out there**-在那里.

> 这里有大量的资源。

One of my favorite retrospective techniques is called the Six Hats Thinking Technique.

> 我最喜欢的回顾技巧之一被称为六顶帽子思考技巧。

In this technique, each team member chooses a different hat to explore the subject of the retrospective.

> 在这种技术中，每个团队成员选择一个不同的帽子来探索回顾的主题。

The different hats each involve a different objective-目的,目标, like discussing positives or negatives that happened during the Sprint or sharing emotive-感情的,情绪的 statements.

> 不同的帽子都有不同的目标，比如讨论Sprint期间发生的积极或消极的事情，或者分享情感陈述。

This helps to ensure that the team takes a well-rounded-丰满的,面面俱到的 approach to the retrospective.

> 这有助于确保团队采用全面的方法进行回顾。

All right, that's it for this video.

> 好了，这个视频就到这里。

Now you've got some idea of some of the common challenges Agile teams might face and how to address them.

> 现在，您已经了解了敏捷团队可能面临的一些常见挑战，以及如何解决这些挑战。

Coming up, we'll explore some more issues you might encounter as a project manager or Scrum Master.

> 接下来，我们将探讨作为项目经理或Scrum Master可能遇到的更多问题。



## Common Agile coaching challenges

> 常见的敏捷指导挑战

Hi again.

In previous videos, we discussed how your role as an Agile project manager or Scrum master is similar to the role of a coach.

> 在之前的视频中，我们讨论了敏捷项目经理或Scrum管理员的角色与教练的角色是如何相似的。

We also explored some of the ways you can help an agile team improve their performance.

> 我们还探讨了一些可以帮助敏捷团队提高绩效的方法。

---

In this video, we'll discuss some more common coaching challenges you might encounter while managing and Agile team or project.

> 在这个视频中，我们将讨论一些你在管理敏捷团队或项目时可能遇到的更常见的教练挑战。

Whether they're a new team or they've been around for awhile-一会儿,片刻.

> 不管他们是一个新团队还是已经存在一段时间了。

The three challenges we'll focus on are managing a stable product roadmap, incomplete-不完整的,不完全的 implementation of Scrum, and experiencing a lack of stability within the team.

> 我们将重点关注的三个挑战是:管理一个稳定的产品路线图，Scrum的不完整实现，以及团队内部缺乏稳定性。

---

First, let's discuss the challenge of managing a stable product roadmap.

> 首先，让我们讨论管理稳定的产品路线图所面临的挑战。

Agile projects almost always experience changes in the product roadmap.

> 敏捷项目几乎总是经历产品路线图的变更。

Being able to respond quickly and productively-有结果地,有成果地 to these changes is a core Agile value.

> 能够快速有效地响应这些变化是敏捷的核心价值。

But it is possible to have too much change impacting the project, which can lead to an unstable product roadmap.

> 但是有可能有太多的变化影响项目，这可能导致不稳定的产品路线图。

---

There are two main causes of an unstable product roadmap; product ambition-野心,追求,抱负 and product assumptions.

> 不稳定的产品路线图有两个主要原因;产品野心和产品设想。

Let's cover product ambition-野心,追求,抱负 first.

> 让我们先谈谈产品野心。

Product ambition poses-造成,引起 a challenge when product leadership is overly-过度地,极度地 ambitious-有抱负的,野心勃勃的 about what the team can realistically-现实地,实际地 deliver. 

> 当产品领导对团队实际能够交付的东西过于雄心勃勃时，产品野心就会带来挑战。

The product owner is responsible for representing the project to customers and executives.

> 产品负责人负责向客户和高管代表项目。

Because the product owner wants to make the stakeholders happy, it can be easy for them to over-promise what the project can deliver.

> 因为产品所有者希望让涉众满意，所以他们很容易对项目能够交付的内容做出过多的承诺。

For example, imagine that our office green CEO notices that the virtual Verdi business in North America is doing really well.

> 例如，假设我们的办公室绿色首席执行官注意到北美的虚拟威尔第业务做得非常好。

In a meeting they say to the product owner, this is amazing.

> 在会议上，他们对产品负责人说，这太神奇了。

I'd love to launch virtual Verdi in Asia-亚洲 in the next four months, what do you think?

> 我想在接下来的四个月里在亚洲推出虚拟威尔第，你觉得呢?

The product owner really wants to deliver so they tell the CEO, sure.

> 产品负责人真的很想交付，所以他们告诉CEO，当然。

But the product owner won't actually know if meeting this objective as possible until they discuss it with the team which means they might accidentally-意外地,偶然地 be setting an unrealistic expectation with the CEO.

> 但是，产品负责人在与团队讨论之前，实际上并不知道是否可以实现这个目标，这意味着他们可能不小心与CEO设定了一个不切实际的期望。

So how do you deal with this challenge?

> 那么你是如何应对这一挑战的呢?

Here are three ideas to maintain a healthy roadmap management plan between you and the product owner.

> 这里有三个想法，可以帮助你和产品负责人之间保持健康的路线图管理计划。

First agreed upfront how to handle new opportunities, define when they are reviewed and estimated, and how customer or management commitments-承诺,保证 are made.

> 首先，预先同意如何处理新机会，确定何时审查和评估它们，以及如何做出客户或管理承诺。

Second, setup regular roadmap reviews with the entire team, at least quarterly so that everyone knows what to expect.

> 其次，与整个团队建立定期的路线图审查，至少每季度一次，这样每个人都知道会发生什么。

Third, promote sharing knowledge between the product owner and the development team so that the product owner knows how much effort the product takes to build and the team is aware of changes as early as possible.

> 第三，促进产品所有者和开发团队之间的知识共享，以便产品所有者知道构建产品需要多少努力，并且团队尽可能早地意识到变更。

---

The second thing that can cause an unstable product roadmap is making too many product assumptions.

> 第二件可能导致产品路线图不稳定的事情是做出太多的产品假设。

When there's uncertainty in a project, you may be required to make some assumptions to move things forward but making too many assumptions can jeopardize-危及,损害 the team's success.

> 当项目中存在不确定性时，您可能需要做出一些假设来推动事情向前发展，但做出太多假设可能会危及团队的成功。

Let's go back to our virtual Verdi example.

> 让我们回到虚拟的威尔第的例子。

Sending plants to customers homes is a complex process.

> 将植物送到客户家中是一个复杂的过程。

You need to consider a lot of different factors like which plants will sell best, which plants will stay healthy in a wide variety-多样化,种类 of climates-气候 and settings, and what vendors to work with?

> 你需要考虑很多不同的因素，比如哪种植物卖得最好，哪种植物在各种气候和环境下都能保持健康，和什么供应商合作?

The team does their best to study the market and opportunity, but they have to make some assumptions and move forward with decisions, relying on less than perfect information.

> 团队尽最大努力研究市场和机会，但他们必须做出一些假设，并根据不太完美的信息做出决定。

As a way to deal with product assumption issues, document the assumptions and make them transparent.

> 作为处理产品假设问题的一种方法，记录假设并使其透明。

This allows you to discuss the assumptions as a team and either agree that they're safe assumptions to make or decide to question and double-check them.

> 这允许你们作为一个团队来讨论这些假设，要么同意这些假设是安全的，要么决定质疑并仔细检查它们。

If you do decide to double-check them, you can use unbiased-公正的,无偏见的 user research.

> 如果你决定再次检查它们，你可以使用无偏见的用户研究。

Unbiased-公正的,无偏见的 user research gathers information about what users really want.

> 无偏见的用户研究收集用户真正想要的信息。

It allows you to confirm or reject-拒绝,否决 assumptions and helps you move forward with confidence.

> 它允许你确认或拒绝假设，并帮助你自信地前进。

User research could involve conducting surveys, running focus groups, or using other methods to collect objective data about your users.

> 用户研究可以包括进行调查，运行焦点小组，或使用其他方法来收集关于用户的客观数据。

---

The next big challenge you might encounter relates to an incomplete implementation of Scrum.

> 你可能遇到的下一个大挑战与Scrum的不完整实现有关。

This happens when Scrum practices are only partially-不完全地,部分地 implemented or when Scrum practices are implemented without proper support and coaching.

> 当Scrum实践只是部分实现，或者Scrum实践在没有适当支持和指导的情况下实现时，就会发生这种情况。

Scrum roles, artifacts and activities are designed to work together as a set.

> Scrum角色、工件和活动被设计成一个整体来协同工作。

If you only partially implement them, you might end up reducing their benefits.

> 如果你只是部分地实现它们，你可能最终会减少它们的好处。

Incomplete implementation of Scrum can cause a lot of issues.

> 不完整的Scrum实施会导致很多问题。

First, it can lead to a loss of clear roles and responsibilities.

> 首先，它会导致角色和责任的缺失。

To implement Scrum completely-完全地,彻底地, you should define the roles for the team and then fill those roles with specific individuals-个人,个体.

> 为了完全实现Scrum，你应该为团队定义角色，然后用特定的个人来填补这些角色。

For example, if you try to have a developer also act as the Scrum master, they might not have the bandwidth-带宽 to do either role very well.

> 例如，如果你试图让一个开发人员同时担任Scrum主管，他们可能没有足够的带宽来很好地担任这两个角色。

Better to have developers beyond the development team and you, the project manager, be the Scrum master.

> 最好有开发团队之外的开发人员，而你作为项目经理，成为Scrum的管理者。

You might also be tempted to skip some events or blend-混合,融合 them to save time.

> 为了节省时间，你可能会跳过一些活动，或者把它们混在一起。

But a lack of clear boundaries for sprint review, sprint retrospective, and sprint planning can lead to reduced transparency, inspection, and adaptation and these are all essential to experience the full benefits of Scrum.

> 但是，对于sprint评审、sprint回顾和sprint计划缺乏明确的界限，可能会导致透明度、检查和适应性的降低，而这些都是体验Scrum的全部好处所必需的。

Finally, not providing the team with the Scrum coaching they need would also mean that you haven't fulfilled your role as Scrum master.

> 最后，没有为团队提供他们需要的Scrum指导也意味着你没有履行Scrum主管的职责。

It's your job to fully explain the Scrum practices and provide coaching so your team understands the reasoning behind the practices and can embrace their benefits.

> 你的工作是全面解释Scrum实践，并提供指导，这样你的团队就能理解实践背后的原因，并接受它们的好处。

The solution to all of these challenges is to implement Scrum completely.

> 解决所有这些挑战的办法是完全实施Scrum。

Being the Scrum master is a critical role.

> Scrum主管是一个至关重要的角色。

You're the coach, so you should reinforce-加强,强化,加固 the connections between the teams activities and the Scrum and Agile values.

> 你是教练，所以你应该加强团队活动与Scrum和敏捷价值观之间的联系。

For example, if your team complains-抱怨,投诉 about daily stand-ups, remind them that the purpose of stand-ups is to gain feedback, unblock-疏通,清除…的障碍 work, ask for help, and reinforce the importance of staying focused on the sprint goals.

> 例如，如果你的团队抱怨每天的站立会议，提醒他们站立会议的目的是获得反馈，疏通工作障碍，寻求帮助，并强调专注于冲刺目标的重要性。

You can also make sure roles are well defined and properly fulfilled.

> 您还可以确保角色被很好地定义并正确地实现。

For example, ensure that all team members understand their own roles as well as the roles of their teammates and how those roles interact.

> 例如，确保所有团队成员都理解他们自己的角色以及他们的队友的角色，以及这些角色是如何相互作用的。

For example, the product owner makes sure we build the right thing, the development team ensures we build it right, and Scrum master ensures we build it fast.

> 例如，产品负责人确保我们构建了正确的东西，开发团队确保我们构建正确，Scrum管理员确保我们快速构建它。

---

Finally, the last big challenge you might encounter with Agile and Scrum teams is a lack of team stability.

> 最后，敏捷和Scrum团队可能遇到的最后一个大挑战是缺乏团队稳定性。

When the team changes a lot with people leaving and joining frequently, it can make things unpredictable and disrupt the flow of work.

> 当团队变化很大，人们频繁离开和加入时，事情就会变得不可预测，工作流程就会中断。

There are few things you can do to address instability on your team.

> 你可以做一些事情来解决团队中的不稳定。

First, have a quick onboarding-新员工入职培训 process for new team members to help them get to know the rest of the team and understand the project.

> 首先，为新团队成员提供一个快速的入职流程，帮助他们了解团队的其他成员并理解项目。

Second, use a pair programming style where a new team member teams up with a colleague-同事,同僚 and starts learning on the job.

> 其次，使用结对编程风格，即新团队成员与同事合作并开始在工作中学习。

This also helps if people leave the team, since a partner should be able to pick up where they left off.

> 如果有人离开了团队，这也会有帮助，因为合伙人应该能够接替他们离开的地方。

Third, if team composition-成分构成,成分 changes because members keep leaving, try having shorter sprints.

> 第三，如果团队组成因为成员不断离开而改变，试着缩短冲刺时间。

This way, team members can wrap up their last sprint's worth of work before leaving.

> 这样，团队成员可以在离开之前完成最后一个冲刺的工作。

---

To recap, the three main challenges we've covered in this video are managing a stable product roadmap, incomplete implementation of Scrum, and a lack of team stability.

> 总结一下，我们在这个视频中提到的三个主要挑战是管理一个稳定的产品路线图，Scrum的不完整实施，以及缺乏团队稳定性。

I've encountered each of these challenges and more in many of my teams.

> 这些挑战我都遇到过，在我的许多团队中还遇到过更多。

The wonderful thing about Agile is that there's a huge community-社区 of Agilists that are happy to help with any challenges you might come across.

> 敏捷的美妙之处在于，有一个庞大的敏捷开发者社区，他们很乐意帮助你应对任何可能遇到的挑战。

Even an experienced Agilist like myself asked for help now and then.

> 即使是像我这样经验丰富的敏捷专家也会时不时地寻求帮助。

Coming up, we'll explore how Agile is evolving and keeping up with the times.

> 接下来，我们将探讨敏捷是如何发展和与时俱进的。

Now that's an agile way to be.

> 这是一种敏捷的方式。



# Agile opportunities

> 3-video、2-reading material

## The evolution-演变,发展 of Agile

> 敏捷的演变

Hey, welcome back.

Since its creation in 2001, Agile popularity has increased incredibly-难以置信地,非常地 fast.

> 自2001年创建以来，敏捷的受欢迎程度以难以置信的速度增长。

One industry report showed that 85 percent of organizations have adopted a product-centric model, which is associated-联系,关联 with an Agile approach.

> 一份行业报告显示，85%的组织已经采用了以产品为中心的模型，这与敏捷方法相关联。

The state of Agile report describes how 30 percent of those companies using the product-centric model apply a hybrid-混合的,杂种的 of methodologies.

> 敏捷状态报告描述了30%使用以产品为中心模型的公司是如何应用混合方法的。

This means that being able to blend-混合,调和,融合 methods will be a super useful skill to have as you start your project management career. 

> 这意味着当你开始你的项目管理生涯时，能够混合方法将是一项非常有用的技能。

Like we explained in an earlier video, one of the reasons for Agile's growing popularity is that we're in a very VUCA world. 

> 正如我们在之前的视频中解释的那样，敏捷越来越受欢迎的原因之一是我们处于一个非常VUCA的世界。

Businesses face a lot of volatility-易变,波动, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity-模棱两可,模糊性, and they recognize that Agile and the frameworks that derive-派生,起源于,来自 from it are a way to overcome-克服,解决 those challenges.

> 业务面临着大量的不稳定性、不确定性、复杂性和模糊性，他们认识到敏捷及其派生的框架是克服这些挑战的一种方法。

In this video, we'll discuss how Agile has already started evolving and explore some emerging ideas about how it might continue to evolve in the future.

> 在这个视频中，我们将讨论敏捷是如何开始发展的，并探讨一些关于它在未来如何继续发展的新想法。

---

The Agile Manifesto as a mindset-心态,思维方式 or philosophy, hasn't changed much in almost 30 years.

> 敏捷宣言作为一种思维方式或哲学，在近30年的时间里没有太大变化。

The frameworks it inspired though, have continued changing and evolving to keep up with changing business environments.

> 然而，它所启发的框架一直在不断变化和发展，以跟上不断变化的商业环境。

One emerging Agile framework is called DevOps, which combines software development and IT operations.

> 一个新兴的敏捷框架叫做DevOps，它结合了软件开发和IT运营。

Our Google Cloud Platform Business defines DevOps as an organizational and cultural movement-运动 that aims to increase software delivery velocity, improve service reliability, and build shared ownership among software stakeholders.

> 我们的Google云平台业务将DevOps定义为一种组织和文化运动，旨在提高软件交付速度，提高服务可靠性，并在软件利益相关者之间建立共享所有权。

Like all Agile frameworks, DevOps aims to shorten the product lifecycle and deliver software products continuously and with very high-quality.

> 像所有敏捷框架一样，DevOps的目标是缩短产品生命周期，持续交付高质量的软件产品。

DevOps emerged when software companies were faced with trying to figure out how to ensure their software products would run reliably for billions of people across the world, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

> 当软件公司试图弄清楚如何确保他们的软件产品能够每周7天，每天24小时可靠地为全球数十亿人运行时，DevOps出现了。

As someone who spent my first few years at Google studying product breakdowns-故障, I can tell you how difficult this is.

> 作为在谷歌工作的头几年研究产品故障的人，我可以告诉你这有多难。

If a business has the ability to launch products and features fast and reliably-可靠地,确实地 to a global marketplace, that's a significant competitive-竞争的 advantage-有利条件,优势.

> 如果一个企业有能力快速可靠地向全球市场推出产品和功能，这是一个重要的竞争优势。

DevOps is about growing and managing teams and organizations that can build and evolve large-scale-大规模的,大范围的 systems at a rapid-迅速的,快速的 pace. 

> DevOps是关于发展和管理能够快速构建和发展大型系统的团队和组织。

These systems need to be both secure and reliable, so they can better deliver value to customers and organizations.

> 这些系统需要既安全又可靠，这样它们才能更好地为客户和组织提供价值。

If you decide to pursue-追求,致力于 a project manager role in the DevOps framework, you'll venture-冒险 into the future of Agile approaches and large-scale software systems that are literally-真正地,确实地 changing the world.

> 如果您决定在DevOps框架中追求项目经理的角色，那么您将冒险进入敏捷方法和大规模软件系统的未来，这些方法和系统正在改变世界。

Pretty exciting, right?

> 很令人兴奋，对吧?

---

One of the next frontiers-前沿 of Agile is called business agility-敏捷,灵活；, which involves incorporating-包含,合并 Agile principles into the wide sphere-范围,领域 of management, so that the organization can thrive-茁壮成长 in high VUCA environments.

> 敏捷的下一个前沿是业务敏捷性，它涉及到将敏捷原则整合到广泛的管理领域中，以便组织能够在高VUCA环境中茁壮成长。

Organizations that want to become Agile in this sense often find themselves rethinking everything, from financial-财政的,金融的 planning processes, governance-治理 and reporting structures, to hiring and HR practices, and much more.

> 想要在这个意义上变得敏捷的组织经常会发现自己重新思考一切，从财务计划流程、治理和报告结构，到招聘和人力资源实践，等等。

They're looking for ways to make Agile values and frameworks work for larger and larger organizations.

> 他们正在寻找使敏捷价值观和框架适用于越来越大的组织的方法。

As an Agile project manager in a larger organization, you might find yourself using frameworks like Scrum of Scrums or Scaled Agile Framework, also known as SAFe.

> 作为大型组织中的敏捷项目经理，您可能会发现自己使用Scrum of Scrum或缩放敏捷框架(也称为SAFe)等框架。

Check out the resources and readings for this video to learn more.

> 查看本视频的参考资料和阅读材料，了解更多信息。

---

It's also important to call out that Agile has reached a lot of industries beyond-除…之外,超出 technology and software.

> 同样重要的是，敏捷已经扩展到技术和软件以外的许多行业。

Recently, I was asked to give Agile training to the Google sales team in Latin America.

> 最近，我被邀请为拉丁美洲的谷歌销售团队提供敏捷培训。

They experienced major changes in their market and wanted to develop the skills to react quickly to those changes and still-还,依旧,仍然 deliver results.

> 他们经历了市场的重大变化，希望培养对这些变化做出快速反应并仍能交付结果的技能。

During the training, we had great discussions about the benefits of Agile.

> 在培训期间，我们对敏捷的好处进行了很好的讨论。

The team especially liked how Agile can help reduce risk at all stages of their sales cycle, through early feedback and frequent and thorough-彻底的,全面的 discussions with teammates and customers.

> 该团队特别喜欢通过早期反馈以及与团队成员和客户频繁而彻底的讨论，敏捷可以帮助降低销售周期各个阶段的风险。

Even the construction-建筑,建造 industry has started applying an Agile approach to their projects.

> 甚至建筑行业也开始将敏捷方法应用到他们的项目中。

An article published by the Project Management Institute-协会 describes how construction projects used Agile to deal with delays and budget overruns-超支 by translating the Agile Manifesto into construction industry terms, like: silos are minimized and close cooperation-合作,协作 is encouraged.

> 项目管理协会发表的一篇文章描述了建筑项目如何使用敏捷来处理延迟和预算超支，方法是将敏捷宣言翻译成建筑行业术语，比如:孤岛最小化，鼓励密切合作。

---

Finally, Agile methodologies can also be applied to your own personal life.

> 最后，敏捷方法也可以应用到你的个人生活中。

For example, I was planning a move recently and immediately set up a Kanban board to start planning my tasks.

> 例如，我最近在计划一次搬家，并立即建立了一个看板来开始计划我的任务。

Have any projects in your life that could use a Kanban board?

> 在你的生活中有什么项目可以使用看板吗?

How about a garage-车库 cleanup or a family reunion-聚会,团聚 or barbecue-户外烧烤?

> 车库清理、家庭聚会或烧烤怎么样?

Who's on your Scrum Team?

> 谁是你的Scrum团队成员?

From DevOps and business agility-敏捷,机敏 to Agile methodologies in the construction industry and beyond, it's clear that Agile's benefits will be useful for a long time to come.

> 从DevOps和业务敏捷性到建筑行业的敏捷方法，很明显，敏捷的好处将在很长一段时间内发挥作用。

The practitioners-实践者, project managers, and teams who live and breathe the Agile values are the ones that help Agile evolve and advance-前进,进步, which means that you can play an important role in contributing to the future of Agile too.

> 践行敏捷价值观的实践者、项目经理和团队是帮助敏捷发展和进步的人，这意味着您也可以在为敏捷的未来做出贡献方面发挥重要作用。

Coming up, we'll explore how to approach your job search so you can find an opportunity in Agile project management.

> 接下来，我们将探讨如何寻找工作，以便在敏捷项目管理中找到机会。

Meet you there.



## The relationship between Agile and DevOps

> 敏捷和DevOps之间的关系

In the last video, we discussed the role of DevOps in Agile at a high level.

> 在上一个视频中，我们从高层次上讨论了DevOps在敏捷中的作用。

Many organizations have begun to embrace and employ-使用,利用 this approach.

> 许多组织已经开始接受并采用这种方法。

We recommend reading about the relationship between traditional Agile frameworks and DevOps in these articles for further understanding: 

> 我们建议阅读以下文章，了解传统敏捷框架和DevOps之间的关系:

## Scaling Agile

> 扩展敏捷

In the preceding-先前的,前面的 videos, we’ve covered how to run a Scrum team of up to nine team members.

> 在前面的视频中，我们介绍了如何运行一个多达9名团队成员的Scrum团队。

But what do you do if your team is larger than that?

> 但如果你的团队规模比这个大，你该怎么办?

Or if the size of the product or solution is so large that multiple teams are required to do the work?

> 或者如果产品或解决方案的规模太大，需要多个团队来完成这项工作?

In this reading, we will explore five frameworks that scale the Agile approach to address the needs of large initiatives-主动性,积极性,方案 or solutions: 

> 在本文中，我们将探讨五个框架，它们可以扩展敏捷方法，以满足大型计划或解决方案的需求:

**Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Scrum of Scrums**, **Large Scale Scrum (LeSS)**, **Disciplined-训练有素的,遵守纪律的 Agile Delivery (DAD)**, and the **Spotify Model**.



**Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)**

> 规模化敏捷框架(SAFe)

The most popular scaled framework is the [**Scaled Agile Framework**](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) or **SAFe**.

> 最流行的伸缩框架是[**伸缩敏捷框架**](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/)或**SAFe**。

SAFe is a Lean-Agile scaling framework that draws heavily on concepts from Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), DevOps, and Design Thinking methodologies.

> SAFe是一个精益敏捷扩展框架，它大量借鉴了看板、Scrum、极限编程(XP)、DevOps和设计思维方法中的概念。

SAFe puts the goal of delivering value above all else—the first principle of SAFe is “take an economic-经济的,经济学的 view.”

> SAFe 将创造价值的目标置于一切之上——外管局的首要原则是“从经济角度出发”。

The framework organizes all work and teams into “Agile Release Trains” based on value streams; for example, sales.

> 该框架将所有工作和团队组织到基于价值流的“敏捷发布列车”中;例如，销售。

The SAFe framework is mature-成熟的,理智的 and provides detailed guidance on all elements of using SAFe, but some elements are more critical than others.

> SAFe框架是成熟的，并提供了使用SAFe的所有要素的详细指导，但有些要素比其他要素更为关键。

Be sure to check back to the Agile principles and values in the manifesto to be sure you are preserving-保留,保存 agility. 

> 一定要回顾一下宣言中的敏捷原则和价值观，以确保您保留了敏捷性。

SAFe, like most Agile practices, is founded on a set of core values:

> 像大多数敏捷实践一样，SAFe建立在一组核心价值之上:

- **Alignment**: Synchronize the planning and execution of SAFe activities at all levels of the organization. 

	> 一致性:在组织的各个层面同步规划和执行SAFe活动。

- **Built-in-内置 Quality**: Build quality into all stages of solution development. 

	> **内置质量**:将质量构建到解决方案开发的各个阶段。

- **Transparency**: Make execution activities visible at all levels to build trust among teams and across the organization. 

	> **透明度**:使执行活动在所有级别可见，以在团队之间和整个组织中建立信任。

- **Program Execution**: Focus on working systems and business outcomes. 

	> **项目执行**:关注工作系统和业务成果。

- **Leadership-领导**: Model-塑造 the values and principles of SAFe. 

	> **领导**:树立SAFe的价值观和原则。

**Scrum of Scrums**

[**Scrum of Scrums**](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-of-scrums) is a technique for integrating the work of multiple, smaller Scrum teams working on the same project or solution.

> [Scrum of Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-of-scrums)是一种将多个小型Scrum团队的工作集成在同一个项目或解决方案上的技术。

Coordination among teams is critical to ensuring the deliverables from each team can be integrated into one larger, cohesive-使团结的,使凝聚的 deliverable. 

> 团队之间的协调对于确保每个团队的可交付成果能够集成到一个更大的、有凝聚力的可交付成果中是至关重要的。

Scrum of Scrums involves the following elements:

> Scrum of Scrums 包含以下元素:

- A group of at least 12 or more people divided-分开,分配 into Scrum Teams of five to ten people each 

	> 至少12人以上的团队被分成5到10人的Scrum团队

- Scrum of Scrums meetings, which are held once a week, twice a week, or daily. These meetings follow the same format as a Daily Scrum meeting but focus on the Scrum team. In these meetings, you’ll discuss questions like: “What did the team do yesterday? What problems occurred, if any, that are negatively affecting your team? What does your team want to accomplish before we meet again? Is your team blocked from moving forward on any tasks?”

	> Scrum的Scrum会议，每周举行一次，每周两次，或者每天。这些会议遵循与每日Scrum会议相同的格式，但侧重于Scrum团队。在这些会议中，你会讨论这样的问题:“团队昨天做了什么?”发生了什么问题，如果有的话，对你的团队产生了负面影响?在我们再次见面之前，你的团队想完成什么?你的团队是否有任何任务无法向前推进?”

- A **Scrum Master** or designated-任命,指定 “ambassador-大使,代表人物” for each team that participates in the Scrum of Scrums meetings and a **Scrum of Scrums Master** who focuses on the overall Scrum process across multiple teams 

	> **Scrum Master**或为参加Scrum of Scrum会议的每个团队指定的“大使”，以及**Scrum of Scrum Master**，专注于跨多个团队的整体Scrum流程

- Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective meetings 

	> Sprint计划、Sprint评审和Sprint回顾会议

Beyond these very basic guidelines, there is no official framework or methodology to implement Scrum of Scrums.

> 除了这些非常基本的指导方针之外，没有官方的框架或方法来实现Scrum of Scrum。

Scrum of Scrums assumes that teams have a good working understanding of Scrum and are able to apply the scaling principles to how they work.

> Scrum of Scrum假设团队对Scrum有很好的理解，并且能够将扩展原则应用到他们的工作中。

Building on this knowledge, they design and iterate their own approach to coordinate multiple teams working on the same product. 

> 基于这些知识，他们设计并迭代自己的方法来协调开发同一产品的多个团队。



**Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)**

> 大规模Scrum (LeSS)

[**Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS**](https://less.works/)) is a framework that aims to maximize the Scrum team’s ability to deliver value and reduce waste in larger organizations.

> [**大规模Scrum (LeSS**](https://less.works/))是一个框架，旨在最大化Scrum团队在大型组织中交付价值和减少浪费的能力。

LeSS grew out of more than 600 experiments that expanded the practice of Scrum to larger groups. 

> LeSS源自600多个实验，这些实验将Scrum实践扩展到更大的团队。

LeSS includes ten principles for applying the value, elements, and overall purpose of Scrum across an organization.

> LeSS包含了在组织中应用Scrum的价值、要素和总体目标的十条原则。

These principles were designed to create more customer- and collaboration-focused teams.

> 这些原则旨在创建更多以客户和协作为中心的团队。

LeSS teams prioritize learning, transparency, and customer needs.

> LeSS团队优先考虑学习、透明度和客户需求。

The ten LeSS principles are:

> 十项LeSS原则是:

1. **Large-scale Scrum is Scrum:** Apply the values and principles of Scrum to a larger team. 

	> **大规模Scrum就是Scrum:**将Scrum的价值观和原则应用到更大的团队中。

2. **Empirical-经验主义的,以经验为依据的 process control:** Inspect, adapt, and learn from experience to improve processes. 

	> **经验过程控制:**检查、调整和从经验中学习以改进过程。

3. **Transparency:** Ensure clarity-清晰度 and accessibility across a project. 

	> **透明度:**确保整个项目的清晰度和可访问性。

4. **More with less:** Create only necessary processes, roles, artifacts, and waste when scaling. 

	> **少花钱多办事:**在扩展时只创建必要的流程、角色、工件和浪费。

5. **Whole-product focus:** Think holistically-整体论地,全面地 about the product, making sure that all the parts serve the whole.

	> **关注整体产品:**全面考虑产品，确保所有部分都为整体服务。

6. **Customer-centric-中心的,重要的:** Keep the customer’s needs and values at the heart of your process.

	> **以客户为中心:**以客户的需求和价值为核心。

7. **Continuous improvement towards perfection-完美,完善:** Improve the product—and your process—during every single Sprint. 

	> **不断完善:**在每一个Sprint中改进产品和流程。

8. **Systems thinking:** Think about the system as a whole; Don’t get lost in the details. 

	> **系统思维:**将系统视为一个整体;不要迷失在细节中。

9. **Lean thinking:** Seek continuous improvement, aim for perfection, and respect people.

	> **精益思维:**追求持续改进，追求完美，尊重他人。

10. **Queuing theory:** Embrace the Lean principles of “flow,’ manage queue size,” and “minimize multitasking” to keep delivering value. 

	> **排队理论:**采用精益原则“流”，管理队列大小，“最小化多任务”，以保持交付价值。

The LeSS toolkit provides two frameworks—one for up to about 50 people (called **Basic LeSS**) and one for 50–6000+ people (called **LeSS Huge**).

> LeSS工具包提供了两个框架——一个最多可容纳50人(称为**Basic LeSS**)，另一个可容纳50 - 6000多人(称为**LeSS Huge**)。

More information on the LeSS frameworks can be found at [less.works](https://less.works/).

> 关于LeSS框架的更多信息可以在[LeSS .works](https://less.works/)上找到。



**Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)**

> - **纪律敏捷交付(DAD)**

[**Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)**](https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/process/introduction-to-dad) is a hybrid-混合的 approach that combines the strategies from various Agile frameworks, including Kanban, LeSS, Lean Development, Extreme Programming, Agile Modeling, and more.

> [**有纪律的敏捷交付(DAD)**](https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/process/introduction-to-dad)是一种混合方法，它结合了各种敏捷框架的策略，包括看板、LeSS、精益开发、极限编程、敏捷建模等等。

DAD guides people through the process-related decisions that frameworks like SAFe and Scrum of Scrums leave open.

> DAD指导人们完成与过程相关的决策，而像SAFe和Scrum of Scrum这样的框架却没有为之开放。

DAD helps you develop a scaled Agile strategy based on context and desired outcomes. 

> DAD帮助您根据上下文和期望的结果开发可扩展的敏捷策略。

DAD is organized into four “layers”:

> DAD被组织成四个“层次”:

1. **Foundations** discusses the principles, guidelines, Agile concepts, roles and team structure definitions, and Way of Working (WoW).

	> **基础**讨论了原则、指导方针、敏捷概念、角色和团队结构定义以及工作方式(WoW)。

2. **Disciplined DevOps** ensures that solutions are delivered to customers effectively and safely, with data and security management always at the forefront-重要位置,最前沿.

	> **纪律严明的DevOps**确保解决方案有效、安全地交付给客户，数据和安全管理始终处于最前沿。

3. **Value Streams** ensures that solutions are aligned with the organization's business strategy, connecting customers, sales, and portfolio-投资组合 management to the framework.

	> **价值流**确保解决方案与组织的业务战略保持一致，将客户、销售和投资组合管理与框架联系起来。

4. **Disciplined Agile Enterprise-企业 (DAE)** connects the industry marketplace with corporate-公司,集团 governance-治理 and larger enterprise activities.

	> **有纪律的敏捷企业(DAE)**将行业市场与公司治理和更大的企业活动联系起来。

Project managers wishing to implement DAD can read more about the framework in this article: [Going Beyond Scrum](https://disciplinedagileconsortium.org/Resources/Documents/BeyondScrum.pdf).

> 希望实现DAD的项目经理可以在这篇文章中阅读更多关于这个框架的内容:[超越Scrum](https://disciplinedagileconsortium.org/Resources/Documents/BeyondScrum.pdf)。



**The Spotify Model**

> Spotify模式

Another approach you may encounter is the “Spotify Model,” which we discussed in a [previous reading.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/agile-project-management/supplement/Wco3A/the-spotify-model)

> 你可能会遇到的另一种方法是“Spotify模式”，我们在[之前的阅读材料]中讨论过(网址:https://www.coursera.org/learn/agile-project-management/supplement/Wco3A/the-spotify-model)。

It is important to note that Spotify’s model is not a true Agile framework.

> 需要注意的是，Spotify的模型并不是一个真正的敏捷框架。

There is no standard guide on how to implement it.

> 没有关于如何实现它的标准指南。

The model began as a description of how Spotify overcame the challenges of scaling Agile.

> 该模型最初描述了Spotify如何克服扩展敏捷的挑战。

By focusing their efforts on culture, team autonomy-自主性, communication, accountability, and quality, they increased their agility over time.

> 通过将精力集中在文化、团队自主性、沟通、责任和质量上，他们逐渐提高了敏捷性。

Spotify’s approach has had a huge impact on workflows and team structures across the tech world.

> Spotify的做法对整个科技界的工作流程和团队结构产生了巨大影响。

Some of the key components include:

> 其中一些关键组成部分包括:

- **Squads:** Like Scrum teams, Squads are autonomous teams of 6–12 people working toward the same outcome. All Squads include a coach (similar to a Scrum Master) and a Product Owner.

	> **小组:**与Scrum团队一样，小组是由6-12人组成的自治团队，他们朝着同一个目标努力。所有的团队都包括一个教练(类似于Scrum Master)和一个产品负责人。

- **Tribes-部落:** When multiple Squads work on the same feature area, they form a Tribe of 40–150 people. Each Tribe has a Tribe Lead who fosters-促进,培养 collaboration and coordination.

	> **部落:**当多个小队在同一功能区域工作时，他们会形成一个40-150人的部落。每个部落都有一个促进协作和协调的部落首领。

- **Chapters:** Squads may be autonomous-自治的,有自治权的, but specialists (e.g., JavaScript developers) should still align across an organization. Chapters establish best practices and, where necessary, set standards. 

	> **章节:**小组可能是自治的，但专家(例如，JavaScript开发人员)仍然应该在组织中保持一致。章节建立最佳实践，并在必要时设定标准。

- **Guilds-协会,工会:** Any group of people interested in a certain topic can form-形成,构成 a Guild, where people with shared interests-好处 can come together as a community. 

	> 公会:任何对某个主题感兴趣的人都可以组成公会，在那里有共同兴趣的人可以聚集在一起作为一个社区。

While some organizations have had success with this model, be aware that it evolved from Spotify’s already significant Agile experience.

> 虽然一些组织使用这种模式取得了成功，但要注意，它是从Spotify已经很重要的敏捷经验演变而来的。

It is the product of extensive-广阔的,广泛的 introspection-内省,反省 and adaptation and draws heavily on the company’s culture of trust, transparency, and autonomy.

> 它是广泛反省和适应的产物，并在很大程度上借鉴了公司的信任、透明和自主的文化。

Therefore, the value of Spotify’s approach to scaling is not in team names like Squads and Tribes but in how they developed practices that supported and served their organizational culture.

> 因此，Spotify扩大规模的方法的价值不在于像Squads和Tribes这样的团队名称，而在于他们如何开发支持和服务于其组织文化的实践。

To learn more about the Spotify Model, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GK1NDTWbkY) from Henrik Kniberg.

> 要了解Spotify模式的更多信息，请查看Henrik Kniberg的[视频](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GK1NDTWbkY)。



**Best practices for scaling Agile**

> 扩展敏捷的最佳实践

No matter which framework you choose, it’s important to keep a few basic principles in mind:

> 无论您选择哪种框架，记住以下几个基本原则都是很重要的:

- Treat scaling models like SAFe, Scrum of Scrums, LeSS, etc., as general frameworks, not instruction-指导 manuals-使用手册,说明书. 

	> 将SAFe、Scrum of Scrum、LeSS等缩放模型视为通用框架，而不是指导手册。

- Different situations require different solutions. It’s okay to mix and match elements from multiple frameworks, as long as you apply the principles and values of the Agile Manifesto.

	> 不同的情况需要不同的解决方案。只要你应用了敏捷宣言的原则和价值观，混合和匹配来自多个框架的元素是可以的。

- Don’t try to scale without prior-先前的,事先的 Agile experience. Going straight from Waterfall to scaled Agile can be risky without a knowledgeable-有见识的,知识渊博的 guide.

	> 不要在没有敏捷经验的情况下尝试扩展。如果没有知识渊博的指导，直接从瀑布式过渡到规模化敏捷是有风险的。

- Finally, and most importantly, don’t scale if it isn’t necessary. The larger your team, the more complex and difficult your project becomes. 

	> 最后，也是最重要的一点，如果没有必要，不要扩展。你的团队越大，你的项目就会变得越复杂和困难。



**Key takeaway**

Scaling Agile can be as simple as putting two Scrum teams together into a Scrum of Scrums configuration or as sophisticated as training an organization of thousands in the SAFe framework.

> 扩展敏捷可以简单到把两个Scrum团队放在一个Scrum of Scrum配置中，也可以复杂到用SAFe框架培训一个数千人的组织。

When you have a large team or a big deliverable that requires multiple workstreams, think about how you can scale to suit your situation.

> 当您有一个大型团队或需要多个工作流的大型交付物时，请考虑如何扩展以适应您的情况。

Remember that you can modify SAFe, LeSS, and other scaled frameworks to meet the needs of each project.

> 请记住，您可以修改SAFe、LeSS和其他可伸缩框架来满足每个项目的需要。

Make sure your team understands Agile principles before you try to scale since scaling inevitably-不可避免地,必然地 introduces-引入 more waste and complexity.

> 在尝试扩展之前，请确保您的团队理解敏捷原则，因为扩展不可避免地会引入更多的浪费和复杂性。



## Jez: My thoughts on Agile

> Jez:我对敏捷的看法

My name is Jez.

I'm an SRE here at Google, and my job is about making sure that Google's systems stay up and are reliable.

> 我是谷歌的一名SRE，我的工作是确保谷歌的系统保持正常和可靠。

So what would I tell someone who is new to Agile and DevOps about really what this is about and what you do to be effective? 

> 那么，我该怎么告诉那些刚接触敏捷和DevOps的人，这到底是什么，你该怎么做才能有效呢?

Fundamentally, Agile and DevOps are about solving complex problems.

> 从根本上说，敏捷和DevOps都是关于解决复杂问题的。

You solve a big problem by splitting it up into smaller chunks and then working out which of those chunks you can deliver first, in such a way that you will maximize the information that you gain, which will help you solve the bigger problem, and then iterating and keeping on doing that.

> 你解决一个大问题的方法是把它分成更小的部分，然后找出你可以首先交付的部分，这样你就可以最大限度地获得信息，这将有助于你解决更大的问题，然后迭代并继续这样做。

Not only will you discover better how to solve your problem in a way that actually makes life better for your users, makes them more awesome in what they do, you'll also discover about how to do that, like what process will work most effectively.

> 你不仅会发现如何更好地解决问题，让你的用户生活得更好，让他们做得更出色，你还会发现如何做到这一点，比如什么流程最有效。

Here's the user problem that we want to solve.

> 这是我们想要解决的用户问题。

You go and work out how to do it.

> 你去想想怎么做吧。

What I've seen happen in the last ten years is taking the front end of that process, the planning process, and bringing that into the team.

> 在过去的十年里，我所看到的是将这一过程的前端，即计划过程，带到团队中。

Taking the back end part of the process, the release and operational part, and bringing that into the team and then making that very religiously-认真地,审慎地 user-centered.

> 把过程的后端部分，发布和操作部分，带到团队中，然后让它非常以用户为中心。

So how do we make everything user-centered and bring that into the team as well?

> 那么我们如何让一切都以用户为中心，并将其带入团队呢?

That I think has been a big transformation and we are a long way from being done with that.

> 我认为这是一个巨大的转变，我们离完成它还有很长的路要走。

The other piece to success in Agile that I think people talk about but isn't sufficiently-充分地,足够地 internalized-内在化 is that you are going to make a ton of mistakes, especially as a new person, you're going to make a ton of mistakes.

> 我认为人们谈论敏捷成功的另一个因素是，你会犯很多错误，尤其是作为一个新人，你会犯很多错误。

That's okay.

You can't learn if you don't make mistakes.

> 如果你不犯错误，你就无法学习。

First of all, don't expect that you'll get it right the first time or the second time or ever.

> 首先，不要指望你第一次、第二次或永远都能做对。

I still make mistakes **all the time**-总是这样.

> 我仍然总是犯错误。

I've seen actually a lot of evolution of Agile over the 15 years that I've been involved-参加,加入 in it in organizations of all different kinds all over the world.

> 在过去的15年里，我在世界各地各种不同类型的组织中参与了敏捷的发展。

It works.



## Agile project management opportunities

> 敏捷项目管理机会

We just covered the evolution of Agile, and I shared how other organizations are adopting Agile practices.

> 我们刚刚讨论了敏捷的发展，并分享了其他组织是如何采用敏捷实践的。

We also discussed the best mindset for delivering value to users as quickly as possible.

> 我们还讨论了尽快向用户提供价值的最佳心态。

Agile project management opportunities are everywhere.

> 敏捷项目管理的机会无处不在。

Whether you're looking for a new role in Agile or want to incorporate Agile into your current lifestyle or workplace, I have a few tips to help get you there.

> 无论您是在寻找敏捷的新角色，还是想将敏捷融入您当前的生活方式或工作场所，我都有一些建议可以帮助您实现这一目标。

---

Let's start by discussing how to land an Agile project management position.

> 让我们从讨论如何获得敏捷项目管理职位开始。

These types of jobs might show up on job boards as Agile Project Manager, Scrum Master, IT Agile Project Manager, or a DevOps Project Manager.

> 这些类型的工作可能会出现在招聘板上，如敏捷项目经理、Scrum Master、IT敏捷项目经理或DevOps项目经理。

After taking this course, you'll be a great fit for any one of these. 

> 学完这门课程后，你将非常适合这些工作中的任何一个。

Look for a role that suits your experience level, complements your industry domain expertise-专业知识, and offers growth opportunities. 

> 寻找一个适合你的经验水平，补充你的行业专业知识，并提供发展机会的职位。

Also, look for a role that provides a culture that'd be a good fit for you.

> 此外，寻找一个能提供适合你的文化的职位。

And I can't emphasize enough how important it is to find an employer who supports your goals and personal growth.

> 找到一个支持你的目标和个人成长的雇主是多么重要，我怎么强调都不为过。

I'm a hiring manager at Google.

> 我是谷歌的招聘经理。

I've interviewed and hired many project managers here, both Agile and non-Agile, and I'd like to share how I approach interviewing and searching for an excellent Agile project manager for my team.

> 我在这里面试并雇佣了许多项目经理，包括敏捷和非敏捷的，我想分享一下我是如何为我的团队面试和寻找优秀的敏捷项目经理的。

Even if a candidate doesn't have Agile on their resume-简历,履历, one of the first things I ask them is, What's the difference between Agile and Waterfall project management?

> 即使应聘者的简历上没有提到敏捷，我问他们的第一件事就是:敏捷和瀑布式项目管理有什么区别?

Their answer usually tells me instantly-立刻,马上 if they know what Agile is about, and it's a great launching off point for more follow-up questions.

> 他们的回答通常会立即告诉我他们是否知道敏捷是什么，这是一个很好的起点，可以回答更多的后续问题。

In the candidate's answer to that question, I look for a few specific things.

> 在候选人对这个问题的回答中，我寻找一些具体的东西。

I want to know whether the candidate knows that Agile is more than just Scrum, Sprints, and Standups.

> 我想知道候选人是否知道敏捷不仅仅是Scrum、sprint和Standups。

Do they know it's also about founding values that include customer collaboration, value delivery, self-organizing teams?

> 他们知道这也是关于建立包括客户协作、价值交付、自组织团队在内的价值观吗?

I'm also interested to know whether they make Waterfall out to be the worst solution, or do they know that all projects benefit from certain types of approaches, including Waterfall, like clear requirements, risk management, stakeholder awareness-认识,意识, and more.

> 我还想知道他们是否认为瀑布方法是最糟糕的解决方案，或者他们是否知道所有项目都受益于某些类型的方法，包括瀑布方法，如明确的需求、风险管理、涉众意识等等。

I also ask, how do you know when to use an Agile approach or framework on your project?

> 我还会问，你怎么知道什么时候在项目中使用敏捷方法或框架?

Their answer helps me know if they understand how Agile or Scrum can help a project manager with specific challenges and what those challenges are.

> 他们的回答帮助我了解他们是否理解敏捷或Scrum如何帮助项目经理应对特定的挑战，以及这些挑战是什么。

And finally I ask, if you are facing resistance-阻力,反对,抵抗 with your team following a Scrum or Agile practice, how do you convince-说服,劝服,使确信,使信服 them to give it a try?

> 最后我要问的是，如果你的团队在Scrum或敏捷实践中遇到阻力，你如何说服他们尝试一下?

Their answer helps me understand how they use communication and influence skills and whether they truly believe that an Agile team can be self-organizing.

> 他们的回答帮助我理解了他们如何使用沟通和影响技能，以及他们是否真的相信敏捷团队可以自组织。

At Google, our teams sometimes resist-阻挡,抵制 being told what to do, especially because this can diminish-降低,减少 innovation and creativity, so I always want to hire project managers who work with the team and don't try to force-强迫 them to do things a particular way.

> 在谷歌，我们的团队有时会拒绝被告知该做什么，特别是因为这会削弱创新和创造力，所以我总是希望聘请与团队合作的项目经理，而不是试图强迫他们以特定的方式做事。

An important part of every interview is when the candidate gets to ask the interviewers questions.

> 每次面试的一个重要部分就是应聘者向面试官提问。

These could be questions about the job, about the interviewer's experience in project management, about the culture, and about the job expectations.

> 这些问题可以是关于工作的，关于面试官在项目管理方面的经验，关于文化，关于工作期望。

This is a huge opportunity for you as the candidate.

> 作为候选人，这对你来说是一个巨大的机会。

---

As an Agile project manager, you now know how crucial culture is to the success of an Agile project.

> 作为敏捷项目经理，您现在知道了文化对于敏捷项目的成功是多么重要。

This is a great time to ask questions that will help you determine if you'll be happy with this job or not.

> 这是问问题的好时机，这将帮助你决定你是否会对这份工作感到满意。

Some questions you should ask are, how supportive is the management here towards blending-混合,调和 project management approaches?

> 你应该问的一些问题是，这里的管理层对混合项目管理方法的支持程度如何?

What's the first thing I should know about the culture here?

> 关于这里的文化，我首先应该了解的是什么?

And how often will I get to hear about the needs of our users or customers?

> 我多久能听到一次用户或客户的需求?

And what would a typical day look like for me if I were to take on this position?

> 如果我担任这个职位，我的日常工作是怎样的?

Maybe you're not interviewing for a new role, but you want to bring what you learned in this Agile course back to your team.

> 也许你不是在面试一个新角色，但你想把你在敏捷课程中学到的东西带回你的团队。

How would you go about that?

> 你会怎么做呢?

As we discussed, bringing Agile or Scrum to a new team is often challenging if their culture doesn't support it.

> 正如我们所讨论的，如果一个团队的文化不支持敏捷或Scrum，那么将它引入一个新团队通常是具有挑战性的。

---

Here are four things that helped me bring Agile to my teams.

> 以下是帮助我将敏捷引入团队的四件事。

First, start small.

> 首先，从小事做起。

You may be excited by everything you've learned here, but your team might like things how they are.

> 你可能会对你在这里学到的一切感到兴奋，但你的团队可能会喜欢现状。

So introduce Agile practices in bite-sized pieces.

> 所以，要慢慢地介绍敏捷实践。

Maybe start by using a Kanban board, just to keep track of one workstream, or set up a retrospective after a major milestone. 

> 也许可以从使用看板开始，只是为了跟踪一个工作流程，或者在一个重要的里程碑之后建立一个回顾。

Second, listen to feedback.

> 第二，倾听反馈。

The most powerful tool a project manager has is the ability to listen to their team and meet them where they are.

> 项目经理拥有的最强大的工具是倾听团队的声音并满足他们的需求的能力。

When you introduce changes, ask the team how it's going.

> 当你引入变更时，询问团队进展如何。

Get their ideas on how to make it better, and include them in your approach.

> 获得他们关于如何做得更好的想法，并将其纳入你的方法中。

This will amplify-放大,扩大 your small changes into big results for the team.

> 这将把你的小改变放大为团队的大成果。

Third, be strategic.

> 第三，要有策略。

Target your improvements to challenges your team has today—introduce new ways of working that address head on the biggest issues your team's experiencing.

> 针对团队目前面临的挑战进行改进——引入新的工作方式，解决团队面临的最大问题。

For example, maybe your team has trouble estimating effort predictably-可预言地 and always ends up in crunch mode.

> 例如，也许你的团队在预测工作量方面有困难，并且总是以紧急状态结束。

Maybe relative estimation techniques would help with that.

> 也许相对估计技术会有所帮助。

Or maybe you have too many people chiming in on what the product should be.

> 或者可能有太多人在讨论你的产品应该是什么样子。

Introducing a single person who acts as the Product Owner to help ensure consistency in prioritizing features.

> 引入一个单独的人作为产品负责人来帮助确保特性优先级的一致性。

Lastly, find allies-盟友.

> 最后，找到盟友。

You may have setbacks or need to lean-倚靠,靠在 on supporters to bring these ideas back to your team.

> 你可能会遇到挫折，或者需要依靠支持者将这些想法带回你的团队。

Find Agile allies in your organization or network.

> 在你的组织或网络中找到敏捷的盟友。

These allies will give you advice when things get rough-粗略的,大致的 and help you **stick to**-坚持 Agile values and principles.

Throughout this course on the foundations of Agile, we covered the history of Agile, along with the core Agile values and principles.

We learned all about Scrum and how Scrum Teams work.

Then, in this last section, we explored how to introduce Agile practices to an organization and how to coach a team through the process.

Finally, we checked out some of the exciting ways that Agile is evolving and how to apply your knowledge of Agile to your future career in project management.

Coming up in the last and final course of this certification program, you're going to apply everything you've learned to a brand new project.
