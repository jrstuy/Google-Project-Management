We'll discuss motivating-激励,激发,促进,促动 project team members to succeed and providing each person with personalized levels of engagement. 

> 我们将讨论如何激励项目团队成员取得成功，并为每个人提供个性化的参与水平。

And we'll take you through techniques you can use to influence others.

> 我们将带你了解一些可以用来影响他人的技巧。

Let's get started.



## The necessity of project teamwork-团队合作

> 项目团队合作的必要性

Think of a leader who you admire-钦佩,仰慕 and respect.

> 想想你尊敬和钦佩的领导者。

What qualities do they have that makes them a good leader?

> 他们具备哪些品质使他们成为出色的领导者呢？

Maybe they're an active listener.

> 也许他们是积极的倾听者。

Maybe they're great-擅长..的 at fostering a sense of community-社区,社会 for people around them.

> 也许他们擅长营造周围人的社区感。

As a project manager, leadership is a big part of the job.

> 作为项目经理，领导是工作的重要组成部分。

But being a great project manager is about **more than**-不仅仅是 simply leading a team to complete a project.

> 但成为一名出色的项目经理不仅仅是领导团队完成项目。

It's about supporting the people on your team to do their best work, and enabling people to build things they're proud-自豪的,得意的 of.

> 它还包括支持团队成员做出最好的工作，使他们能够构建令他们自豪的东西。

In this video, we'll define teamwork and explain why it's important for successful project management.

> 在这个视频中，我们将定义团队合作，并解释为什么它对于成功的项目管理至关重要。

---

The best leaders are able to get people to work together.

> 最好的领导者能够让人们协同工作。

That's why a project manager's ability to develop and lead teams that work well together is so important.

> 这就是为什么项目经理开发和领导高效协同工作的团队能力如此重要的原因。

But before we go further, let's pause and consider, what exactly is a team?

> 但在我们进一步讨论之前，让我们暂停一下并考虑，什么是团队？

Though-虽然,尽管 there are many different definitions of the word team, here's how we describe it here at Google.

> 虽然对于团队这个词有许多不同的定义，但这是谷歌在这里的定义。

---

A team is a group of people who plan, solve problems, make decisions, and review progress in service of a specific project, or objective.

> 团队是一组人，他们为了特定的项目或目标进行计划、解决问题、做出决策和审查进展。

Team members rely on each other to get things done.

> 团队成员依赖彼此来完成任务。

For example, a software engineering team might be tasked with creating one seamless-无缝的,无缝合线的 software experience that meets users' needs.

> 例如，一个软件工程团队可能被赋予创建一个无缝的软件体验，以满足用户的需求。

Beyond coordinating with the project manager, members of the software engineering team will also coordinate with one another as they work toward their shared goal.

> 除了与项目经理协调之外，软件工程团队的成员还将相互协调，以实现他们共同的目标。

Teams differ from workgroups, which we define as being based on organizational or managerial-经营上的,管理上的 hierarchy-等级体系.

> 团队与工作组不同，我们定义工作组是基于组织或管理层次结构的。

Though people within a workgroup might be working toward a common goal, their work is more likely to be coordinated, controlled, or assigned by a single person or entity-实体,个体.

> 虽然工作组内的人们可能在朝着一个共同的目标努力，但他们的工作更有可能是由一个人或实体协调、控制或分配的。

For example, a workgroup focused on quality assurance testing might be tasked with running a set of test plans.

> 例如，一个专注于质量保证测试的工作组可能被要求运行一组测试计划。

The group manager might split up that work and assign each quality assurance tester a plan to review.

> 团队经理可能会分配工作，并为每个质量保证测试员分配一个计划进行审查。

But unlike a team, the testers will work independently-独立地,自立地 of one another to complete their tasks and will coordinate mainly with the manager and the development team of the feature they're testing.

> 但与团队不同，测试员将独立完成各自的任务，并主要与经理和他们正在测试的功能的开发团队进行协调。

Teams and work groups each have unique benefits-好处,益处 within a larger organization.

> 在较大的组织中，团队和工作组都有独特的好处。

But for the purpose of this program, we'll focus on teams.

> 但对于这个项目的目的，我们将重点放在团队上。

More specifically, we'll discuss how project managers develop-发展 and lead effective teams by fostering a culture of teamwork.

> 更具体地说，我们将讨论项目经理如何通过培养团队合作的文化来发展和领导高效的团队。

Teamwork is an effective collaborative way of working in which each person is committed to and heading-朝某特定方向行进 toward a shared goal. 

> 团队合作是一种有效的协作工作方式，每个人都致力于一个共同的目标。

Teamwork maximizes-使最大化 the individual strength-长处,优势 of each team member to bring out the best in each person.

> 团队合作最大程度地发挥了每个团队成员的个人优势，使每个人都能充分发挥自己的长处。

---

As you might imagine, teamwork is a crucial part of successful project management.

> 正如你所能想象的，团队合作是成功的项目管理的重要组成部分。

There are a few reasons for this.

> 这其中有几个原因。

For one, teamwork fosters creativity.

> 首先，团队合作促进创造力。

A team might leverage-充分利用,影响力,手段 the diverse-不同的,各式各样的 perspectives-视角,观点, skills, and experiences of their members to devise-设计,发明 better solutions and build products that address more diverse user needs than they might have if they were working independently-独立地,自立地 of each other. 

> 一个团队可以利用其成员的多样化观点、技能和经验，制定更好的解决方案，构建满足更多不同用户需求的产品，这可能比他们独立工作时更好。

Teamwork also encourages accountability-责任,责任心.

> 团队合作还鼓励负责。

The knowledge that the execution of your tasks directly impacts the tasks of the rest of the team can be a powerful motivator-动力,激励因素. 

> 知道你的任务执行直接影响到其他团队成员的任务可以是一个强大的激励因素。

And most importantly, teamwork helps you **get stuff done-完成任务**.

> 最重要的是，团队合作有助于你完成任务。

Big complex projects need smart, capable-有能力的,有本领的 people to complete tasks and to reach milestones to meet the project goals.

> 大型复杂的项目需要聪明、有能力的人来完成任务，达到里程碑，以实现项目目标。

As the project manager, it's your job to encourage others to actively engage in working together as a team to foster creativity, encourage accountability, and to get stuff done.

> 作为项目经理，你的工作是鼓励其他人积极参与团队合作，以培养创造力，鼓励负责，以及完成任务。

---

Teamwork is an effective collaborative way of working, and when done right, it can positively impact both measurable-可衡量的,可测量的,显著的 team results and the team culture.

> 团队合作是一种有效的协作工作方式，如果做得正确，它可以积极影响可衡量的团队结果和团队文化。

Coming up, we'll take you through the elements of effective teams.

> 接下来，我们将带你了解高效团队的要素。

Meet you there.

> 在那里见。



## The factors that impact team effectiveness

> 影响团队效率的因素

Teams are made up of individuals, and individuals are driven by different motivators.

> 你的团队是由个体组成的，而个体受到不同的激励因素驱动。

Whether that's serving their organization, supporting their family, or simply working on projects they find interesting.

> 无论是为组织服务、支持家庭，还是仅仅是从事他们认为有趣的项目。

You'll need to learn about the people on your team in order to best determine how to motivate everyone at the same time.

> 为了最好地确定如何同时激励每个人，你需要了解团队中的人。

A few years ago, researchers here at Google set out to identify the dynamics of effective teams, and through this research, they identified five factors that have an impact on team effectiveness.

> 几年前，谷歌的研究人员着手确定有效团队的动态，通过这项研究，他们确定了影响团队效能的五个因素。

In order of importance, those five factors are: psychological-心理的,精神的 safety, dependability-可靠性,可信任, structure and clarity, meaning, and impact.

>  按重要性顺序，这五个因素分别是：心理安全、可靠性、结构和清晰度、意义和影响。

Let's break these down.

> 让我们来详细讨论这些。

---

Let's start with psychological safety, which is **the number one**-第一 factor that impacts team effectiveness.

> 我们先从心理安全开始，这是影响团队效能的第一因素。

Here's how our researchers define it.

> 以下是我们的研究人员如何定义心理安全的。

Psychological safety refers to an individual's perception-感觉,感知 of the consequences-结果,后果 of taking interpersonal risks.

> 心理安全指的是个体对于采取人际风险后果的感知。

In other words, they believe it's safe to take risks within their team, and they don't risk being labeled as ignorant, incompetent-无能力的,不称职的, negative, or disruptive-引起混乱的,破坏性的.

> 换句话说，他们认为在团队内采取风险是安全的，他们不会被贴上无知、无能、消极或破坏的标签。

On teams with high psychological safety, teammates feel comfortable-令人舒适的,感到舒服的,安逸的 taking risks around fellow team members, seeking differing opinions, and resolving interpersonal conflict-冲突,争执 when it comes up.

> 在拥有高度心理安全感的团队中，团队成员感到在同事面前采取风险、寻求不同意见以及在出现人际冲突时解决问题是舒适的。

For example, on my team at Google, we like to say "be direct and kind-宽容的."

> 例如，在谷歌的我的团队中，我们喜欢说“直言不讳，善待他人”。

We've worked really hard to build a team culture in which we can hold one another accountable while maintaining a shared space that is safe, secure, and peaceful.

> 我们非常努力地建立了一个团队文化，在这个文化中，我们可以相互负责，同时保持一个安全、安心和和平的共享空间。

What I found is that when opportunities to take risks do arise-产生,出现, like pitching an out-of-the-box idea to my directors, for example, this culture of mutual-相互的,彼此的 respect-尊敬,尊重 has already laid the groundwork-基础,准备工作 to get direct feedback without frustration-懊恼,沮丧 or worrying that I might embarrass-（使）尴尬,窘迫 myself.

> 我发现的是，当采取风险的机会出现时，比如向我的主管提出一个独具特色的想法，这种相互尊重的文化已经为获取直接反馈奠定了基础，而不会感到沮丧或担心自己会出丑。

And that's been invaluable-极有用的,极宝贵的 in maintaining a high level of psychological safety for the team.

> 这对于保持团队的高度心理安全感来说是非常宝贵的。

---

Next, we have dependability-可靠性,可信任.

> 接下来，我们有可靠性。

Google's researchers explain it this way.

> 谷歌的研究人员这样解释。

On dependable teams, members are reliable and complete their work on time.

> 在可靠的团队上，成员是可靠的，按时完成工作。

Creating a dependable team requires the combination-结合,联合 of setting, negotiating-磋商,洽谈, and meeting expectations.

> 创建一个可靠的团队需要设定、协商和满足期望的结合。

Yes, your team needs to meet the expectations set for them.

> 是的，你的团队需要满足为他们设定的期望。

At the same time, you as a project manager need to establish a two-way-双向的,相互的 relationship with your team.

> 与此同时，作为项目经理，你需要与你的团队建立双向关系。

You have to be able to clearly communicate expectations and ensure that the team feels comfortable-舒适的 negotiating with you when needed.

> 你必须能够清晰地传达期望，并确保团队在需要时感到舒适地与你进行协商。

For example, it's likely that a person on your team works on two or more projects with competing-竞争,对抗 deadlines.

> 例如，你的团队中可能有一个人在两个或更多的项目上工作，这些项目有竞争性的截止日期。

If they're afraid to share their own constraints with you, then their work on both projects might suffer-受折磨.

> 如果他们害怕与你分享自己的限制，那么他们在两个项目上的工作可能会受到影响。

Alternatively, if they come to you with their concerns and open understanding and negotiation around priorities could help ease-减轻,缓和 their burden-负担,责任.

> 或者，如果他们来找你谈谈他们的顾虑，并在优先事项周围进行开放的理解和协商，可以帮助减轻他们的负担。

---

Next, we have structure and clarity.

> 接下来，我们有结构和清晰度。

Here's how our researchers define it.

> 以下是我们的研究人员如何定义结构和清晰度的。

Structure and clarity refers to an individual's understanding of job expectations, knowledge of how to meet those expectations, and the consequences of their performance.

>  结构和清晰度是指个体对工作期望的理解，对如何满足这些期望的知识，以及他们绩效的后果。

Each team member has a clear sense of their individual role, plans, and goals, and they have a sense of how their work affects the group.

> 每个团队成员都清楚自己的角色、计划和目标，他们也清楚自己的工作对团队的影响。

You as the project manager can help foster a sense of structure and clarity on the team.

> 作为项目经理，你可以帮助团队建立结构和清晰度的感觉。

For example, if project structure and tracking are sloppy-马虎的,草率的, unorganized, and incohesive-无凝聚力的, then the team's output is likely to be sloppy, unorganized, and incohesive.

> 例如，如果项目结构和跟踪混乱、无组织、不协调，那么团队的产出很可能也是混乱、无组织、不协调的。

This can cause tension-紧张,焦虑 within the team.

> 这可能会在团队内部引起紧张。

Alternatively, if you diligently-勤奋地,勤勉地 engage in project tracking, your team will have clarity, feel more united-团结的,统一的, and will be able to effectively collaborate-合作,协作.

> 或者，如果你努力参与项目跟踪，你的团队将会更加明了，感到更加团结，将能够有效地合作。

---

Meaning-意义 also impacts team effectiveness.

> 意义也影响团队的效益。

Google's researchers defined meaning in this context as finding a sense of purpose either in the work itself or in the results of that work.

> 谷歌的研究人员在这个背景下定义了意义，即在工作本身或工作结果中找到目标感。

For example, your teammates might find meaning in supporting themselves financially, helping the team reach its goals, or wanting their products to reach a new community of users.

> 例如，你的团队成员可能会在经济上支持自己，帮助团队实现目标，或者希望他们的产品能够达到新的用户群体。

---

And finally, we have impact.

> 最后，我们有影响力。

Our researchers define impact as the belief that the results of one's work matters-事情 and creates change.

> 我们的研究人员将影响力定义为相信一个人的工作成果是重要的，并创造了变化。

It can be challenging-挑战 for people to notice how their work can shift an entire ecosystem forward.

> 让人们注意到他们的工作是如何推动整个生态系统向前发展的，这可能是一项挑战。

Part of your role as the project manager is to help individual teammates identify how they drive impact both within the team and beyond it.

> 作为项目经理，你的部分职责是帮助每个团队成员确定他们如何在团队内外产生影响。

Project tracking can be a helpful tool for visualizing progress and impact.

> 项目跟踪可以是可视化进度和影响的有用工具。

Meeting milestones, for example, demonstrates-证明,示范,演示 to the team how their individual tasks contribute to the larger project goals.

> 例如，达到里程碑向团队展示了他们的个人任务是如何为更大的项目目标做出贡献的。

For example, my team focuses on routing within Google Maps.

> 例如，我的团队专注于谷歌Maps中的路由。

The big idea is to focus on helping people get to where they're going on time.

> 重点是帮助人们准时到达他们要去的地方。

So, everything we do should make that experience-体验,经验 incrementally better.

> 所以，我们所做的一切都应该让这种体验逐渐变得更好。

And that's how we add impact.

> 这就是我们增加影响力的方式。

---

To recap, Google's researchers identified psychological safety, dependability, structure and clarity, meaning, and impact as the top five factors that have an impact on team effectiveness.

> 综上所述，谷歌的研究人员确定了心理安全、可靠性、结构和清晰度、意义和影响是影响团队效率的五大因素。

Coming up, we'll discuss how project managers lead teams that reach project goals.

> 接下来，我们将讨论项目经理如何领导团队实现项目目标。



# Effective project leadership

> 有效的项目领导力

## Leading high-functioning teams

> 领导高功能团队

Hi again, there are a few key ways that project managers help build high-functioning teams who work together to meet project goals.

>  嗨，再次见面，项目经理在帮助构建高效团队以共同实现项目目标方面有一些关键方法。

They create systems that turn chaos-混乱,混沌 into order;

> 他们创造了将混乱变为有序的系统;

They communicate and listen;

> 他们进行沟通并倾听；

They promote-促进,提倡 trust and psychological safety;

>  他们促进信任和心理安全；

They demonstrate empathy and create motivation;

> 他们表现出同情并激发动力；

They delegate responsibility and prioritize;

>  他们委派责任并确定优先级；

And they celebrate the team's success.

> 他们庆祝团队的成功。

Let's go through each of those points one by one.

> 让我们逐一讨论这些要点。

---

Good project managers lead their teams by creating systems that turn chaos into order.

> 优秀的项目经理通过创建将混乱转化为秩序的系统来引导他们的团队。

You can do this by creating, implementing, and improving: standardize-使标准化, measurable, repeatable and scalable workflows and processes for your team.

>  您可以通过为您的团队创建、实施和改进标准化、可衡量、可重复和可扩展的工作流程和流程来做到这一点。

For example, if you find that you're usually chasing-追赶,追逐 down teammates for progress on their work, you might set up a process for how and when a teammate should let you know that they've completed a task.

> 例如，如果您通常需要追踪队友的工作进展，您可以建立一个流程，规定队友应该如何以及何时通知您他们已完成了任务。

Think of creating systems as a kind of connect the dots puzzle-谜题,拼图.

> 把创建系统想象成一种连接点的谜题。

Being a project manager is sort of like that, but there are no numbers, just dots and a partial image.

> 作为一个项目经理有点像这样，但没有数字，只有点和部分图像。

But we don't need the numbers.

> 但我们不需要数字。

We can notice the dots, know their importance and string-用线穿,串起 them together to help everyone visualize the project as a whole.

> 我们可以注意到这些点，了解它们的重要性，并将它们串在一起，帮助每个人将整个项目视觉化。

You find the system through the chaos and help other people to find it, too.

>  您通过混乱找到系统，并帮助其他人也找到它。

---

Another way that project managers lead is through communicating and listening.

> 项目经理领导的另一种方式是通过沟通和倾听。

As the project manager, it's your job to ensure that everyone on your team is on the same page regarding-认为,把……看作 the status of your project.

> 作为项目经理，您的工作是确保您团队的每个人对项目的状态达成一致。

For example, you might communicate with the team via-经过,通过 daily or weekly status update emails and regular team meetings.

> 例如，您可以通过每日或每周的状态更新电子邮件和定期团队会议与团队进行沟通。

Team meetings also provide a space for listening, whether you're gathering feedback on a workflow or process, or fielding-回应,回答 questions from the group.

> 团队会议还提供了倾听的空间，无论您是收集工作流程或流程的反馈，还是回答团队的问题。

You can also solicit-请求,征求 feedback or questions via status update emails, since some people might feel more comfortable speaking in private.

> 您还可以通过状态更新电子邮件征求反馈或提问，因为有些人可能在私下更愿意发表意见。

**In addition to**-除了…之外 communicating and listening to the wider team, it's also your responsibility to regularly connect with individual teammates.

> 除了与整个团队进行沟通和倾听之外，您还有责任定期与个别队友联系。

You do this by gaining an understanding of communication styles and by asking people on your team how they prefer to communicate.

> 您可以通过了解沟通风格，以及向您团队中的人询问他们如何更喜欢沟通来做到这一点。

What's important to know is that everyone communicates differently.

> 重要的是要知道，每个人的沟通方式都不同。

For example, I might make small talk with colleagues who I know enjoy it.

> 例如，我可能会和我知道喜欢的同事闲聊。

Or I might get straight-径直地,坦率地 to the point with colleagues who prefer not to chat-聊天.

> 或者我可能会和那些不喜欢聊天的同事开门见山。

---

Project managers also lead by promoting trust and psychological safety within their team.

> 项目经理还通过促进团队内部的信任和心理安全来领导。

As a reminder, psychological safety refers to an individual's perception-感觉,感知 of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk.

> 提醒一下，心理安全是指个体对承担人际风险后果的感知。

Team members need to trust that they're safe and speaking up if they have feedback or concerns about the project as a whole or about their individual tasks.

> 团队成员需要相信他们是安全的，如果他们对整个项目或他们的个人任务有反馈或担忧，他们就会说出来。

It's your job to create a team atmosphere-气氛,环境 where different opinions are welcome, and all members remain respectful-表示敬意的,尊敬的 of one another during challenging conversations.

> 您的任务是创建一个团队氛围，不同的意见受到欢迎，在具有挑战性的对话期间，所有成员都彼此保持尊重。

For example, during weekly status meetings, you might schedule time for open, thoughtful-深思熟虑的 and inclusive-包容广阔的,包含的 discussions.

> 例如，在每周的状态会议中，您可以安排时间进行开放、深思熟虑和包容的讨论。

You might model this by asking for help solving a problem that's impacting the team.

> 您可以通过请求帮助解决影响团队的问题来建立模型。

You should encourage contributions from all team members regardless-无论如何 of role or rank-地位,等级

> 你应该鼓励所有团队成员的贡献，不管他们的角色或级别

By doing this, you make clear to your teammates that they should feel comfortable-舒适的 challenging processes and workflows.

> 通过这样做，您可以让您的团队成员清楚，他们应该对挑战流程和工作流程感到舒适。

And you make clear that critiques-评论 of the project and plans are welcomed and valued **no matter**-不论,不管 who they come from.

> 你要明确表示，对项目和计划的批评是欢迎和重视的，无论这些批评来自谁。

While it can feel challenging to provide and accept feedback, it's a healthy part of project management and usually makes for a better project outcome.

> 虽然提供和接受反馈会让人觉得很有挑战性，但这是项目管理中健康的一部分，通常会带来更好的项目结果。

---

On an individual level, project managers lead by practicing empathy and creating motivation for their team members.

> 在个人层面上，项目经理通过实践同理心和为团队成员创造动力来领导。

It's possible you've heard the phrase, "there's no I in team," and while that's true that teams need to work together to be effective, it's also important to remember that teams are made up of individuals with differing motivations and lives outside of work.

> 你可能听过这句话，“团队中没有我”，虽然团队需要一起工作才能有效，但同样重要的是要记住，团队是由有着不同动机和工作之外生活的个人组成的。

You can demonstrate empathy for your teammates by being present-在场的,出席的, listening, and asking questions.

> 你可以通过在场、倾听和提问来表达对队友的同情。

During one on one conversations, avoid making assumptions about what the other person is thinking and feeling.

> 在一对一的谈话中，避免臆测对方的想法和感受。

If you're quiet-安静的,平静的 and curious-好奇的,求知欲强的, there's always more to learn.

> 如果你安静而好奇，你总有更多的东西要学。

In addition to showing empathy for my team, I also like to create motivation by recognizing-表扬,表彰 a job well done through public forums.

> 除了对我的团队表示同情之外，我还喜欢通过公共论坛来表彰出色的工作，以此来激发动力。

Like in a meeting or a group email.

> 比如在会议或群组邮件中。

Recognition-表彰,赞誉 tells people that they're doing the right things, and motivates-激励,激发,成为…的动机 them to keep up the good work.

> 认可告诉人们，他们正在做正确的事情，并激励他们保持良好的工作。

Be sure to recognize good work, and not just heroic-英雄的,英勇的,巨大的 efforts.

> 一定要认可优秀的工作，而不仅仅是英勇的努力。

---

Project managers also lead by delegating responsibility and prioritizing.

> 项目经理还通过委派责任和确定优先级来进行领导。

Most projects will likely have multiple tasks taking place simultaneously-同时地.

> 大多数项目可能会同时进行多个任务。

And it's your job to keep the team focused and heading toward the project goals and deliverables.

> 你的工作就是让团队保持专注，朝着项目目标和可交付成果前进。

By delegating responsibility for specific tasks to individuals on your team, you provide your teammates with the opportunity to add value using their particular set of skills.

> 通过将特定任务的责任委派给团队中的个人，您为团队成员提供了使用其特定技能增加价值的机会。

You also give yourself space to focus on the project as a whole.

> 你也给了自己空间去关注整个项目。

By prioritizing tasks, you reduce ambiguity-模棱两可,不明确 and provide clarity for your team.

> 通过对任务进行优先排序，您可以减少歧义并为团队提供清晰度。

If you think that a task is important, but your team doesn't, they might work on whatever tasks they like.

> 如果你认为一项任务很重要，但你的团队并不重要，他们可能会做任何他们喜欢的任务。

By prioritizing and making that prioritization known, you keep the team focused.

> 通过划分优先级并让大家知道优先级，你可以让团队保持专注。

Work with your team to build consensus-一致看法,共识 around priorities, explaining your rationale-根本原因,逻辑依据 can help you get their **buy-in**-认同,支持 and increase their commitment-奉献,热情 to the work.

> 与你的团队合作，围绕优先事项建立共识，解释你的基本原理可以帮助你获得他们的支持，并增加他们对工作的承诺。

---

Lastly, project managers lead by celebrating team success, both at the end of the project and throughout-自始至终,遍及 it.

> 最后，项目经理通过庆祝团队的成功来领导，无论是在项目结束时还是在整个过程中。

This includes celebrating big and small wins like reaching a milestone or receiving positive feedback from stakeholders. 

> 这包括庆祝大大小小的胜利，比如达到一个里程碑或从利益相关者那里得到积极的反馈。

Celebrating success is an important tool for motivating the team because it increases morale-士气,精神面貌 and boosts-增加 the team's engagement.

> 庆祝成功是激励团队的重要工具，因为它可以提高士气，提高团队的参与度。

---

To recap, project managers build high-functioning teams in a few key ways:

> 总而言之，项目经理通过以下几个关键方式构建高功能团队:

creating systems that turn chaos into order;

communicating and listening;

promoting trust and psychological safety;

demonstrating empathy and creating motivation;

delegating responsibility and prioritizing;

and celebrating team success.

As you grow in your career, you'll strengthen-加强,巩固 your ability to lead bigger and more complex teams, but the principles of teamwork will remain-保持不变 the same.

> 随着你在职业生涯中的成长，你领导更大、更复杂团队的能力会增强，但团队合作的原则将保持不变。

Coming up, you'll learn about the stages of team development and how to manage team dynamics.

> 接下来，您将了解团队发展的各个阶段以及如何管理团队动态。

I'll see you soon.



## Providing “air cover - 空中掩护” to your team

> 为你的团队提供空中掩护

As you have learned so far, project managers build teams that meet project goals in many different ways, from delegating responsibility and prioritizing tasks to promoting trust and psychological safety. 

> 正如您到目前为止所了解的，项目经理构建团队以许多不同的方式来满足项目目标，从委派责任和确定任务的优先级到促进信任和心理安全。

But there is another skill great project managers have that we will cover in this reading: the ability to provide **air cover** to protect their team.

> 但是，优秀的项目经理还有另一项技能，我们将在本文中介绍:提供“空中掩护”以保护团队的能力。

Air cover refers to support for and protection of a team in the face of out-of-scope requests or criticism-批评,批判 from leadership. 

> 空中掩护是指在面对超出范围的要求或领导的批评时对团队的支持和保护。

**What is air cover?**

> 什么是空中掩护?

A lot of what we have covered throughout this program has focused on leading and managing a project team.

> 我们在整个课程中所涵盖的很多内容都集中在领导和管理项目团队上。

Much of project management involves overseeing the work of others, but it also involves managing the needs and expectations of those above-高于,在...上面 you.

> 很多项目管理包括监督他人的工作，但也包括管理上级的需求和期望。

Those people are your stakeholders, project sponsors, and other leaders within your organization. 

> 这些人是你的利益相关者、项目发起人和组织中的其他领导。

---

Though the needs and requests of your stakeholders are crucial to the project’s success, there may come a time when you will need to prioritize the needs of your team over the wants of your stakeholders.

> 尽管涉众的需求和请求对项目的成功至关重要，但有时您需要优先考虑团队的需求，而不是涉众的需求。

This is called providing “air cover” for your team, and it is an important part of managing a project.

> 这被称为为你的团队提供“空中掩护”，这是管理项目的重要组成部分。

The ability to effectively provide air cover requires a trusting relationship between a project manager and their stakeholders.

> 有效提供空中掩护的能力需要项目经理和利益相关者之间的信任关系。

In this relationship, the project manager aims-目标,目的 to demonstrate their abilities to lead a team and communicate effectively. 

> 在这种关系中，项目经理的目标是展示他们领导团队和有效沟通的能力。

---

There is some risk involved in providing air cover.

> 提供空中掩护是有风险的。

Sometimes a project manager provides air cover and the project team is still unable to deliver on the goals of the project.

> 有时，项目经理提供空中掩护，但项目团队仍然无法实现项目目标。

In this case, stakeholders may question the project manager’s ability to complete projects successfully.

> 在这种情况下，干系人可能会质疑项目经理成功完成项目的能力。

So, when preparing to defend your team against-以...为背景 out-of-scope requests, be sure that you are confident-自信的,有信心的 in your team’s progress toward the project goal.

> 因此，当准备保护您的团队免受超出范围的请求时，请确保您对团队朝着项目目标的进展充满信心。

**Providing air cover: A case study**

> 提供空中掩护:案例研究

Imagine, for example, that you are a project manager for a brand of coffee sold in supermarkets-超市 throughout your region.

> 例如，想象一下，您是一个在您所在地区的超市销售的咖啡品牌的项目经理。

You and your team have been tasked with launching three new flavors-风味,滋味 of ground coffee: vanilla-香草味的, hazelnut-榛子, and mocha-摩卡. 

> 



![Image of three bags of coffee: one vanilla, one hazelnut and one mocha](img/23.png)

However, well into the execution phase, your project sponsor sets a meeting with you to make an out-of-scope request: They would like to add a **caramel-flavored**-焦糖味 coffee to the product lineup-阵容.

> 然而，在执行阶段，您的项目发起人与您安排了一次会议，提出了一个超出范围的请求:他们想在产品阵容中添加一种焦糖风味的咖啡。

Your team is already at maximum capacity preparing to launch the agreed-upon flavors, and a fourth flavor would add an unreasonable-不合理的,不切实际的 amount-量,数量 of work and stress-使受压力,使受重压 to your very busy team.

> 您的团队已经达到了最大容量，准备推出商定的口味，而第四种口味会给您非常忙碌的团队增加不合理的工作量和压力。

Let’s discuss how you might provide air cover for your team in a situation like this one.

> 让我们讨论一下在这种情况下，你如何为你的团队提供空中掩护。

**Saying “No” without explicitly-直截了当地,坦率地 saying “No”**

> 说“不”而没有明确说“不”

One way to provide air cover to your team is to say “no” to your sponsor’s request without *explicitly* saying “no.” 

> 为你的团队提供空中掩护的一种方法是对赞助商的请求说“不”，但不要“明确地”说“不”。

There are a few ways to do this:

> 有几种方法可以做到这一点:

- You can gently-温柔地,平缓的 push back with a polite-有礼貌的,客气的 explanation that their request won’t be possible to complete under the current constraints—the scope, time, and/or cost—of the project. 

	> 你可以温和地反驳，礼貌地解释说，在当前的限制条件下——项目的范围、时间和/或成本——他们的要求不可能完成。

- You can politely-有礼貌地,客气地 offer to get back to the stakeholder with your response. This gives you time to better understand the request and to consult with trusted team members to lay out the benefits and costs of this request. And, if you are lucky, this might even give the stakeholder the opportunity to reconsider their request or forget about it entirely.

	> 你可以礼貌地提出要把你的回应反馈给利益相关者。这使您有时间更好地理解请求，并与值得信赖的团队成员协商，以列出该请求的收益和成本。而且，如果幸运的话，这甚至可能给涉众重新考虑他们的请求或完全忘记它的机会。

Whether you choose to **push back**-推迟,反驳 immediately or get back to your stakeholder with your response, it is crucial to offer alternative-替代物,可替代的 solutions.

> 无论你是选择立即反击还是将你的回应反馈给你的利益相关者，提供替代解决方案是至关重要的。

Maybe the project timeline can expand-扩大,扩展 to accommodate-顺应,适应 the request.

> 也许项目时间表可以扩展以适应请求。

Or maybe you and your team have a strong relationship with another team at the organization that can help fulfill the request. 

> 或者，也许你和你的团队与组织中的另一个团队有着牢固的关系，可以帮助完成请求。

Whatever the alternative, brainstorming other options can help soften-减轻,削弱 the blow-失望,打击 and provide stakeholders with new ideas.

> 无论选择什么，集思广益其他选择可以帮助减轻打击，并为利益相关者提供新的想法。

---

For example, you consider telling your sponsor that the current project timeline will only allow for the launch of three new coffee flavors-风味,滋味, and that the launch of a fourth flavor would only be possible by pushing the launch date back by two months.

> 例如，你考虑告诉你的赞助商，目前的项目时间表只允许推出三种新的咖啡口味，而第四种口味的推出只有将发布日期推迟两个月才有可能。

If you were to respond to your sponsor in this way, you would be both gently-文静地,温柔地 refusing-拒绝 their request and offering them an alternative that could work for your team.

> 如果你以这种方式回应你的赞助商，你既可以委婉地拒绝他们的要求，也可以为他们提供一个适合你的团队的替代方案。

---

While a simple “no” response might frustrate-使懊恼,使沮丧 the person making the request, gentle-文静的 pushback-抗拒,反对 paired with alternative options can protect your team from new work while preserving-保护,维护 your professional relationship with stakeholders.

> 虽然一个简单的“不”的回答可能会让提出请求的人感到沮丧，但温和的拒绝加上其他选择可以保护你的团队免受新工作的影响，同时保持你与利益相关者的专业关系。

If your stakeholders trust your leadership abilities and perspective, then they will be more likely to accept your pushback and alternative solutions.

> 如果你的利益相关者信任你的领导能力和观点，那么他们将更有可能接受你的反对意见和替代解决方案。

**Intervening-干涉,介入 from behind the scenes**

> 从幕后介入

Another way project managers provide air cover for their teams is to master-精通,掌握 the challenge of delicately-微妙地,精致地 intervening from behind the scenes when a stakeholder is making unrealistic requests or offering unreasonable-不合理的,不切实际的 critiques-评论,批判. 

> 项目经理为团队提供空中掩护的另一种方式是，当利益相关者提出不切实际的要求或提出不合理的批评时，掌握在幕后微妙干预的挑战。

Continuing with our coffee company example, you know how hard your team has been working to launch the new products.

> 继续以咖啡公司为例，你知道你的团队为推出新产品付出了多大的努力。

To avoid causing the extra stress that might come with the knowledge that the stakeholder wants to increase their workload, you avoid sharing this request with your entire project team.

> 为了避免由于涉众想要增加他们的工作量而带来额外的压力，您应该避免与整个项目团队共享此请求。

---

This doesn’t mean you need to come up with a solution all by yourself, however-然而,可是.

> 然而，这并不意味着你需要自己想出一个解决方案。

Instead of calling a team meeting to discuss the stakeholder’s request for a new flavor, you consult with only two trusted members of your team to help brainstorm solutions.

> 您不需要召开团队会议来讨论涉众对新口味的要求，而是只与团队中两个值得信赖的成员进行磋商，以帮助头脑风暴解决方案。

One of these team members mentions-提到,谈到 that they know two new flavors are slated to be added to the fall-秋季 product lineup in six months, and that perhaps the caramel flavor could be launched then instead of with the current group.

> 其中一名团队成员提到，他们知道两种新口味将在六个月内加入秋季产品阵容，也许焦糖口味可以在那时推出，而不是现在的团队。

This would give your team more time to work on developing the product while still fulfilling the stakeholder’s request. 

> 这将给你的团队更多的时间来开发产品，同时仍然满足涉众的要求。

---

Ultimately, you bring the suggestions of adding the flavor to the fall-秋季 product lineup or pushing back the launch date of the current lineup to the project sponsor, and they accept your solution to launch the new flavor in the fall.

> 最后，你向项目发起人提出在秋季产品阵容中添加口味或推迟当前产品阵容的推出日期的建议，他们接受你的解决方案，在秋季推出新口味。

Managing the expectations of your stakeholder while looping-循环 in relevant teammates on a need-to-know basis was essential here. 

> 管理涉众的期望，同时在需要知道的基础上循环相关的团队成员，这是必不可少的。

This allowed your team to focus on their work without the possibility of an increased workload or an unnecessary distraction-使人分心的事物,干扰.

> 这可以让你的团队专注于他们的工作，而不会增加工作量或不必要的分心。

**Key takeaway**

Providing air cover for your team takes practice.

> 为你的队伍提供空中掩护需要练习。

It requires a careful balance of the needs of your stakeholders and the needs of your project team.

> 它需要仔细平衡涉众的需求和项目团队的需求。

As you become more experienced in leading projects, you will develop a stronger sense of how to manage nuanced-细微差别 situations like these and provide the air cover your team needs to do their best work. 

> 随着你在领导项目方面的经验越来越丰富，你会对如何管理这些微妙的情况有更强的感觉，并为你的团队提供所需的空中掩护，让他们把工作做到最好。

And it's important because as a project manager, as we've said in these courses, you're not going to know or you're not going to have a lot of the technical or specific domain expertise-专长,专门技能 that you need in order to create the big meaty-内容丰富的 things that you're trying to drive.

> 这很重要，因为作为一个项目经理，正如我们在这些课程中所说的，你不会知道或者你不会有很多技术或特定领域的专业知识，你需要这些来创造你想要推动的大的东西。

But as a program or a project manager, you're kind of the leader who's supposed-应当的 to be making sure things get done, and you work with every little piece of the pie.

## Team development and managing team dynamics

> 团队发展和管理团队动态

Imagine that you're starting a new project with a brand new team of people.

> 想象一下，你正在和一个全新的团队一起开始一个新项目。

No one on the team has worked together before, so this will be a new experience-体验,经历 for everyone.

---

To better understand how your team might develop over time, let's discuss the psychologist-心理学家 Bruce Tuckman's five stages of team development.

> 为了更好地理解你的团队是如何随着时间的推移而发展的，让我们来讨论一下心理学家布鲁斯·塔克曼的团队发展的五个阶段。

Forming-形成, storming-风暴, norming-规范,标准, performing-执行,履行 and adjourning-休会.

> 形成，风暴，规范，表演和休会。

These stages of development illustrate how teams grow from a disparate-迥然不同的,无法比较的 group of people into a high functioning unit-单位.

> 这些开发阶段说明了团队如何从一群完全不同的人成长为一个高功能的单位。

You might even recognize the characteristics-特征,特点 of each stage from previous experiences working on a team.

> 你甚至可以从之前的团队工作经验中认识到每个阶段的特点。

---

Tuchman's first stage of team development is the forming stage.

> 塔奇曼认为团队发展的第一阶段是形成阶段。

At this point everything feels shiny-光滑发亮的,有光泽的 and new.

> 在这一点上，一切都是崭新的。

Individuals-个人,个体 on the team are just getting to know on another, and they're eager-渴望的,渴求的 to make a good impression-印象,作用.

> 团队中的每个人刚刚开始相互了解，他们都渴望给人留下好印象。

And typically they're excited for the work to begin.

> 通常他们对工作的开始感到兴奋。

During this stage, you as a project manager should clarify project goals, roles, and context about the project.

> 在这个阶段，作为项目经理的你应该明确项目目标、角色和项目背景。

People are seeking guidance-指导,指引 and it's your job to provide that guidance.

> 人们在寻求指导，而你的工作就是提供指导。

---

The second stage of team development is the storming stage, this is where things get a bit trickier-难对付的,棘手的.

> 团队发展的第二个阶段是风暴阶段，这是事情变得有点棘手的阶段。

As people settle-（对......）适应,习惯（于） into their roles and the work on their project begins, the people on your team are interacting more and maybe disagreeing-有分歧,意见不合 a bit.

> 当人们适应了自己的角色，开始了他们的项目时，团队中的人会有更多的互动，可能会有一些分歧。

This is where feelings of frustration-懊恼,沮丧 might emerge-浮现,出现.

> 这就是挫败感可能出现的地方。

Individuals might take issues with certain processes they feel are inefficient-效率低的, or other teammates they disagree with, especially when the team is navigating tasks that are much more complex-复杂的 than they first appeared.

> 个人可能会对他们认为效率低下的某些流程或他们不同意的其他团队成员提出问题，特别是当团队正在处理比他们最初出现的要复杂得多的任务时。

It makes sense, right?

> 这很有道理，对吧?

If you're working closely with a new group of people for the first time, there's bound to be some interpersonal-人际的,人际关系的 conflict-争执,争论. 

> 如果你第一次和一群人密切合作，肯定会有一些人际冲突。

Teammates might disagree on time, and effort estimations, vary in their levels-程度 of independence-独立性, or prefer to prioritize certain tasks over other equally important tasks.

> 团队成员可能在时间和工作量估计上意见不一，他们的独立程度不同，或者更喜欢优先处理某些任务，而不是其他同等重要的任务。

As the project manager, it's your job to focus on conflict resolution.

> 作为项目经理，专注于解决冲突是你的工作。

Listen-倾听 as the team addresses problems to solve and share insights on how the team might better function as a unit.

> 倾听团队解决问题的过程，并分享团队如何更好地作为一个整体运作的见解。

---

After storming comes Tuchman's third stage, the norming stage.

> 风暴过后是塔奇曼的第三个阶段，规范阶段。

At this point, the team has resolved some of its internal conflict by establishing new norms.

> 在这一点上，团队已经通过建立新的规范解决了一些内部冲突。

Like processes and workflows that make it easier for everyone to get things done.

> 比如流程和工作流程，让每个人都能更容易地完成工作。

The team feels better equipped-使能够胜任 to work together efficiently-高效地 and effectively-有效地.

> 团队感觉能够更好地高效合作。

You, as the project manager should codify-编纂 the team norms, ensuring that the team is aware of those norms and reinforce-加强,强化 them when needed.

> 作为项目经理，您应该编纂团队规范，确保团队意识到这些规范，并在需要时加强它们。

For example, if you've agreed to discuss solutions to issues during weekly team meetings, ensure that your weekly agenda-议事日程 budgets time for this topic each week.

> 例如，如果你已经同意在每周的团队会议上讨论问题的解决方案，确保你的每周议程为这个主题预算了时间。

---

Tuchman's fourth stage is the performing stage.

> 塔奇曼的第四个阶段是表演阶段。

During this time, the team works together relatively-相当地,相对地 seamlessly-无缝地,无瑕疵的 to complete tasks, reach milestones and make progress toward the project goal.

> 在此期间，团队相对无缝地一起工作，以完成任务，达到里程碑并朝着项目目标前进。

In the performing stage, you as the project manager should focus on delegating, motivating and providing feedback to keep up the team's momentum-动力,势头.

> 在执行阶段，作为项目经理的你应该专注于授权、激励和提供反馈，以保持团队的动力。

---

The fifth and final stage of team development is the adjourning-休会 stage.

> 团队发展的第五个也是最后一个阶段是休会阶段。

In this stage the project is **wrapping up**-结束或完成某个事件或行动的行为 and it's time for the team to disband-解散.

> 在这个阶段，项目即将结束，是时候解散团队了。

It can be a bittersweet-苦乐参半的 time for the team and you might want to mark the end of the project with a celebration.

> 对于团队来说，这可能是一个苦乐参半的时刻，你可能想要庆祝一下项目的结束。

You as the project manager should set up time to celebrate the final milestones and success of the project as a group.

> 作为项目经理，你应该安排时间来庆祝项目的最终里程碑和团队的成功。

And be sure each member of your team knows what's next for them.

> 确保团队中的每个成员都知道他们接下来要做什么。

---

Okay, to recap, Tuckman's five stages of team development are forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning.

> 概括一下，塔克曼说的团队发展的五个阶段分别是组建，风暴，规范，表演和休会。

These stages of team development come together to form-形成,构建 a helpful framework you can use to assess-评估 and recognize team dynamics, and then adjust your management style accordingly.

> 团队发展的这些阶段汇集在一起，形成一个有用的框架，您可以使用它来评估和识别团队动态，然后相应地调整您的管理风格。

Team dynamics refer to the forces-力,力量 both conscious-意识到的 and unconscious-没意识到的, that impact team behavior and performance.

> 团队动力是指影响团队行为和绩效的有意识和无意识的力量。

---

Managing team dynamics is a big part of determining how to motivate-激励,鼓励 your team.

> 管理团队动态是决定如何激励团队的重要组成部分。

It might be tempting-引诱,诱惑 to assume-假定,假设 that people can go full-speed ahead into a project.

> 假设人们可以全速推进一个项目，这可能很诱人。

But in reality, it's important to take time to understand the dynamics of your team overall and how individual team members are fitting-适合,适应 in.

> 但在现实中，花时间了解整个团队的动态以及团队成员如何适应是很重要的。

This is especially-尤其,特别 important during the more precarious-不稳固的,危险的 forming and storming stages.

> 这在更不稳定的形成和风暴阶段尤其重要。

---

Let's break down why managing team dynamics is so important.

> 让我们来分析一下为什么管理团队动态如此重要。

First, teams have individuals with different skill sets, varying degrees-程度 of autonomy-自主权,自主性, and competing priorities.

> 首先，团队中的个人拥有不同的技能、不同程度的自主权和相互竞争的优先级。

It's your job to forge-形成,锻造 consensus-一致看法,共识 and set clear purposes, goals, dependencies and accountability.

> 你的工作是达成共识，设定明确的目的、目标、依赖关系和责任。

When teams function cohesively-聚合在一起地,团结地, they can focus on the tasks and objectives at hand.

> 当团队团结一致地工作时，他们可以专注于手头的任务和目标。

---

Another reason why it's important to manage team dynamics is that it helps you to create a collaborative-合作的,协作的 and psychologically safe environment.

> 管理团队动态很重要的另一个原因是，它可以帮助你创造一个协作和心理安全的环境。

When team members feel safe, they're willing to help one another, and accept help when they need it.

> 当团队成员感到安全时，他们愿意互相帮助，并在需要时接受帮助。

This benefits the entire project by keeping schedules on track.

> 这有利于整个项目的进度。

Though it can take time to get to the performing stage, using the norming stage as a time to foster-培养,培育 a collaborative environment can help you get there quicker.

> 虽然达到执行阶段可能需要时间，但将规范阶段作为培养协作环境的时间可以帮助您更快地达到目标。

---

Understanding and managing team dynamics can also help you understand how to motivate your team.

> 理解和管理团队动态也可以帮助你了解如何激励你的团队。

Motivated team members are likely to contribute more to discussions, complete their tasks and actively participate in other project activities.

> 受到激励的团队成员可能会在讨论中贡献更多，完成他们的任务并积极参与其他项目活动。

A positive team atmosphere-气氛,环境 can help employees feel empowered.

> 积极的团队氛围可以让员工感到自己被赋予了权力。

More comfortable taking calculated risks, and more likely to seek out innovative-创新,革新 solutions to complex problems.

> 更愿意承担经过计算的风险，更有可能为复杂问题寻求创新的解决方案。

Remember, so much of team dynamics happens under the surface.

> 记住，很多团队动态都发生在表面之下。

Identifying and understanding the stages of team development can help you make sense of how dynamics are playing out on your team.

> 识别和理解团队发展的各个阶段可以帮助你理解团队的动态变化。

This can help you to be a better leader.

> 这可以帮助你成为一个更好的领导者。

---

Coming up, we'll discuss what it means to promote ethical and inclusive-包容广阔的 leadership in the workplace.

> 接下来，我们将讨论在工作场所促进道德和包容性领导的意义。

Meet you there.



## Rowena: Delegating the details

> 罗威娜:委派细节

Hi. I'm Rowena, a Senior Program Manager in the Systems Productivity and Reporting Team in Google Cloud.

> 嗨。我是Rowena, 谷歌Cloud系统生产力和报告团队的高级项目经理。

As a project manager, you'll find that you're not actually the direct manager of people in their roles.

> 作为一个项目经理，你会发现你实际上并不是他们角色中的直接管理者。

The key soft skill to have here is around influence; influencing without authority-权威,威信.

> 关键的软技能是周围的影响;没有权威的影响。

It's the ability to be able to communicate with people and make sure that they understand your goals and objectives and take them along on a shared vision and shared journey.

> 这是一种与人沟通的能力，确保他们理解你的目标和目的，并与他们分享共同的愿景和旅程。

When I first became a project manager, one of the mistakes that I often made was trying to do everything for myself and not asking for help.

> 当我第一次成为项目经理时，我经常犯的错误之一就是试图为自己做任何事情，而不是寻求帮助。

Over the course of the last couple of years, I've really learned how to delegate and work with others as part of a team to make sure that I'm effectively-有效地 managing a project as a project manager regardless-无论如何 of whether I have management or authority-权限 over the project team, and allowing those SMEs to really do what they're really good at.

> 在过去的几年里，我真的学会了如何作为团队的一部分来授权和与他人合作，以确保我作为一个项目经理有效地管理一个项目，而不管我是否对项目团队有管理或权限，并允许那些中小企业真正做他们真正擅长的事情。

Delegating for me in my day-to-day role looks like this: I try to find subject matter experts or people that really enjoy doing a specific something that may not actually be their role-角色,职责.

> 在我的日常工作中，委派是这样的:我试着去找那些真正喜欢做某些特定事情的专家或人，而这些事情可能并不属于他们的职责。

One of the best pieces of advice I ever got from a mentor-导师 was around finding people in the organization that enjoy doing something and delegating your work to them.

> 我从一位导师那里得到的最好的建议之一就是在组织中找到喜欢做某事的人，并把你的工作委托给他们。

That way you can focus on overall project or program management without having to get bogged-沼泽 down in the weeds by certain details that actually you might not enjoy doing or someone else really enjoys doing.

> 这样，您就可以专注于整个项目或计划管理，而不必陷入实际上您可能不喜欢做或其他人真正喜欢做的某些细节的泥潭中。

Psychological safety is really important in teams because it brings diversity-多样性 of thought-思想,想法 to the table.

> 心理安全在团队中非常重要，因为它带来了思想的多样性。

One thing that I'm really working on is making sure that we practice inclusive-包容广阔的,包括的 meetings.

> 我真正在努力的一件事是确保我们练习包容性会议。

An example of that could be in a meeting if you notice that one or two participants are usually quiet-安静的,不出声的 or don't speak up, try to encourage them to be a part of the conversation.

> 举个例子，在会议中，如果你注意到一两个参与者通常很安静或不说话，试着鼓励他们加入到谈话中来。

Even better, have a coffee with them before and ask them what they think of the upcoming topic.

> 更好的是，在谈话前和他们一起喝杯咖啡，问问他们对即将到来的话题的看法。

Encourage them to bring those ideas to the table.

> 鼓励他们把这些想法提出来。

Having diversity-多样性,多样化 of thought in the room is so important.

> 在会议室里保持思想的多样性是非常重要的。

Otherwise, you're going to end up with one person in the room constantly just bringing their thoughts and ideas to the table. 

> 否则，你最终会看到房间里只有一个人不断地把他们的想法和想法带到桌子上。

That's not very diverse-多样的,多种多样的.

> 这不是很多样化。

One thing with psychological safety is this partnership with mentorship-导师制 and sponsorship-赞助.

> 心理安全的一件事是与导师和赞助的伙伴关系。

To delegate, I make sure that I sponsor-赞助 people.

> 为了授权，我确保我赞助了一些人。

I make sure that I showcase-展示,展现 their best quality work across the whole project team.

> 我确保在整个项目团队中展示他们最高质量的工作。

It's really important for morale-士气,精神面貌.

> 这对鼓舞士气非常重要。

On the other side with mentorship, if there's a junior-资历较浅的 team member on a team that maybe doesn't have the experience or isn't as confident-自信的,充满信心的 speaking up, I usually delegate smaller tasks to them to build up their confidence-自信的,充满信心的 or delegate something that they might actually consider to be fun that's not in their normal day-to-day work.

> 另一方面，如果团队中有一个资历较浅的成员可能没有经验，或者没有信心说出来，我通常会把一些较小的任务委派给他们，以建立他们的信心，或者委派一些他们可能认为有趣的事情，而这些事情不是他们日常工作的一部分。

Finding those unique balances is the best way to delegate and prioritize.

> 找到这些独特的平衡是委派和优先排序的最好方法。

> 举个例子，看看近年来工作文化是如何演变的。

Around the world, employees working for organizations of all kinds have been calling on their employers-雇主,老板 to adopt-采取 ethical policy changes and to state their positions-立场 on current events.

> 在世界各地，为各种组织工作的员工一直在呼吁他们的雇主采取道德政策的改变，并表明他们对当前事件的立场。

Companies can demonstrate ethical leadership by creating forums where employees can raise-提出 their viewpoints-观点,看法, be heard and receive follow-ups from company leaders on employee concerns.

Ethical leadership is closely tied-捆绑,结合 to inclusive leadership.

> 道德领导与包容性领导密切相关。

If ethical leadership's aim is to create forums where employees' concerns can be heard, inclusive leadership aims to put what we've heard into action to create an environment that encourages.

> 如果说道德领导的目标是创造一个论坛，让员工的担忧得到倾听，那么包容性领导的目标则是把我们听到的付诸行动，创造一个鼓励员工的环境。

And empowers each and every member of our community.

> 并赋予我们社区的每一个成员权力。

That in turn leads to more innovation and better solutions.

> 这反过来又会带来更多的创新和更好的解决方案。

Here's how we think about inclusion-包含,包容,认同感,归属感 here at Google.

> 以下是谷歌对包容的看法。

Inclusive leadership is when everyone's unique identity, background and experiences are respected, valued and integrated into how the team operates-运转,运行.

> 包容性领导是指每个人独特的身份、背景和经历都受到尊重、重视，并融入到团队的运作方式中。

These differences improve the team culture, collaboration, innovation and output.

> 这些差异改善了团队文化、协作、创新和产出。

Inclusive leadership is related to diversity in that diversity is the set of differences each of us possesses-拥有,持有, whether visible or invisible that gives us each a unique perspective on the world and our work.

> 包容性领导与多样性有关，因为多样性是我们每个人都拥有的一系列差异，无论是可见的还是不可见的，这些差异使我们每个人对世界和工作都有独特的看法。

Inclusion is what the team does with that diversity of thought and perspective.

> 包容性是团队在思想和观点多样化的情况下所做的事情。

At Google, we've identified three ways that managers can lead inclusively.

> 在谷歌，我们已经确定了三种管理者可以包容性领导的方式。

These include fostering a culture of respect, creating equal opportunity to succeed and inviting and integrating diverse perspectives.

> 这包括培养一种尊重的文化，创造平等的成功机会，并邀请和整合不同的观点。

To foster a culture of respect, it's your job as a project manager to serve as a role model-榜样的, set the tone for the team and take action when needed.

> 为了培养一种尊重的文化，作为项目经理，你的工作就是树立榜样，为团队定下基调，并在需要的时候采取行动。

That means modeling the values of your organization, taking appropriate action if misconduct-不端行为 occurs.

> 这意味着树立组织的价值观，在不当行为发生时采取适当的行动。

Creating an environment in which team members feel comfortable speaking up with concerns, and recognizing-认可,承认 team contributions regularly.

> 创造一个让团队成员畅所欲言的环境，并定期认可团队的贡献。

---

To create equal opportunity to succeed, you should ensure that each person on the team has access to the information and resources they need to do their best work.

> 为了创造平等的成功机会，你应该确保团队中的每个人都能获得他们需要的信息和资源，以最好地完成工作。

You do this through regular communication, accessible documentation, and regular check-ins with the team to listen, share information, ask and answer questions and provide support.

> 您可以通过定期沟通、可访问的文档以及与团队的定期签入来实现这一点，以倾听、共享信息、提问和回答问题并提供支持。

As a project manager, you're in the perfect spot to identify work that might be a good fit for a person who really wants it, but who shies-害羞的 away from asking for it.

> 作为一名项目经理，你处在一个绝佳的位置，可以确定哪些工作可能适合那些真正想要它，但却羞于提出要求的人。

Knowing an individual's aspirations-愿望,渴望,抱负 will help you highlight these opportunities.

> 了解一个人的愿望将帮助你突出这些机会。

---

Finally, to invite and integrate diverse perspectives, it's your role to cultivate-培育,培养 a culture in which each team member's perspective can be openly shared, heard and integrated into work related decisions.

> 最后，为了邀请和整合不同的观点，你的角色是培养一种文化，在这种文化中，每个团队成员的观点都可以公开分享、倾听并融入到与工作相关的决策中。

You do this by creating a sense of psychological safety on the team and by inviting teammates to share their thoughts, ideas and concerns, regardless-不管怎样,无论如何 of their role or rank on the team.

> 你可以通过在团队中创造一种心理安全感，并邀请团队成员分享他们的想法、想法和担忧，而不管他们在团队中的角色或级别。

---

Developing ethical and inclusive leadership skills requires regular-经常的,频繁的,定期的 practice.

> 培养道德和包容的领导技能需要经常练习。

So whether you're leading a project team of two, or 20, or 200, you should be diligent-勤奋的,勤勉的 in building up your inclusive leadership skill set by creating an environment in which your team feels safe, heard and valued.

> 因此，无论你领导的是2人、20人还是200人的项目团队，你都应该通过创造一个让你的团队感到安全、被倾听和被重视的环境，努力建立你的包容性领导技能。

You can do this by fostering a culture of respect, creating equal opportunity to succeed and inviting and integrating diverse perspectives.

> 你可以通过培养一种尊重的文化，创造平等的成功机会，并邀请和整合不同的观点来做到这一点。

In the next lesson, we'll discuss the fundamentals of influencing, as well as some common mistakes that people make when attempting-努力,尝试 to influence others.

> 在下一课中，我们将讨论影响的基本原理，以及人们在试图影响他人时常犯的一些错误。

**Ethics within your organization**

> 组织内部的道德规范

**Ethics** can be defined as the principles of conduct governing-统治,管理 an individual or a group.

> **伦理**可以定义为支配个人或群体的行为准则。

However, there is no single, universally-accepted grouping of ethical standards—these definitions differ based on the culture and community at your company.

**A common framework for ethical decision-making**

> 道德决策的共同框架

The [Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/) developed the following framework as a helpful guide for ethical decision-making. 

![Recognize an ethical issue, get the facts, evaluate alternative actions, make a decision and test it, act and reflect](img/24.png)

**Recognize an ethical issue**

> 认识道德问题

According to this framework, you can begin to question the ethics of an issue by asking yourself questions about the nature of the issue.

> 根据这个框架，你可以通过问自己关于问题本质的问题来开始质疑一个问题的伦理性。

Could your decision negatively impact another person or group of people?

> 你的决定是否会对另一个人或一群人产生负面影响?

Does the issue go beyond what is legal or efficient?

> 这个问题是否超出了法律或效率的范畴?

From there, you can proceed-开始行动,开展 onto fact gathering.

> 从这里开始，你可以进行事实收集。

- **Example**: A vendor you have worked with in the past sends you a generous-大量的 holiday gift shortly before you are about to select a vendor for a particular task in your project. If you accept the gift, would others be negatively impacted? To determine the answer to this question, get more facts.

	> **示例**:在您即将为项目中的特定任务选择供应商之前，过去与您合作过的供应商送了您一份慷慨的节日礼物。如果你接受了这份礼物，其他人会受到负面影响吗?要确定这个问题的答案，需要更多的事实。

**Get the facts**

> 了解事实

Decide what you should do about the issue, and seek answers as needed.

> 决定你应该如何处理这个问题，并在需要时寻求答案。

Consult with the right people to consider all of the options available to you.

> 向合适的人咨询，考虑所有可能的选择。

- **Example**: Continuing with the example above, you should check to see if your company has ethics guidelines regarding-与……有关,涉及 accepting gifts from external parties. If not, consult with your HR representative-代表 about the matter.

	> **例子**:继续上面的例子，你应该检查一下你的公司是否有关于接受外部礼物的道德准则。如果没有，请咨询你的人力资源代表。

**Evaluate alternative-替代物,可替代的 actions**

> 评估备选行动

You can evaluate alternative actions by asking yourself the following questions:

> 你可以通过问自己以下问题来评估备选行动:

- “Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm-伤害,损害?”

	> “哪种选择会产生最大的好处，造成最小的伤害?”

- “Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake-利害关系?” 

	> “哪种选择最能尊重所有利害攸关者的权利?”

- “Which option treats people equally or proportionally-成比例地?”

	> “哪种选择对人是平等的还是按比例的?”

- “Which option best serves the community as a whole, not just some members?”

	> “哪种选择最适合整个社区，而不仅仅是部分成员?”

- “Which option leads me to act as the sort of person I want to be?”

	> “哪种选择能让我成为我想成为的那种人?”

Note that your answers to these questions are subjective-主观的, and you may want to elicit-引出,得到 the opinion of others before deciding on an alternative action.

> 请注意，你对这些问题的回答是主观的，你可能想在决定采取另一种行动之前征求别人的意见。

- **Example**: In the case of the vendor gift example, the answer to the question “Which option treats people equally or proportionally?” might be “decline-拒绝,谢绝 the gift,” given that accepting it might influence your decision about who to award the contract-合同 to.

	> **例子**:在供应商礼物的例子中，“哪种选择对人们是平等的还是按比例的?”可能是“拒绝礼物”，因为接受礼物可能会影响你决定将合同授予谁。

**Make a decision and test it**

> 做出决定并测试它

Once you have chosen an option, test it by imagining the reaction-反应,回应 to your choice from a person whose opinion-意见,看法 you value. 

> 一旦你选择了一个选项，通过想象一个你重视的人对你的选择的反应来测试它。

- **Example**: Once you have decided to decline the gift, discuss your decision with your manager, HR representative, or a trusted colleague.

	> 示例:一旦你决定拒绝这份礼物，与你的经理、人力资源代表或值得信赖的同事讨论一下你的决定。

**Act and reflect-深思,反省,反射 on the outcome**

> 行动并反思结果

Consider how to carry out your decision with thoughtfulness-考虑周到的 and care, and after you act, consider the results of your decision.

> 考虑一下如何深思熟虑地执行你的决定，在你行动之后，考虑一下你的决定的结果。

- **Example**: Respectfully decline-拒绝,谢绝 the vendor’s gift, noting your reason (for example, your company’s ethical guidelines state that employees are not permitted-批准,许可 to accept gifts valued at more than $20 from vendors or contractors).

	> **示例**:礼貌地拒绝供应商的礼物，并注明理由(例如，贵公司的道德准则规定，员工不得接受供应商或承包商提供的价值超过20美元的礼物)。

---

**Key takeaway** 

> 关键要素

A framework-构架,结构 like this one can help you feel better-equipped-更好的使有所准备,使能够胜任 to make ethical decisions regarding-关于,涉及 your project and team, which is a central component of ethical leadership.

> 像这样的框架可以帮助你更好地为你的项目和团队做出道德决策，这是道德领导的核心组成部分。

Like so much of project management, ethical leadership takes diligence-勤奋,用功 and practice, and it is crucial to build this skill.

> 像许多项目管理一样，道德领导需要勤奋和实践，建立这种技能至关重要。

As you become more comfortable leading project teams, you will strengthen-巩固（地位）,加强（实力） your ability to make decisions that you can feel good about.

> 当你能更自如地领导项目团队时，你会加强你做出让你感觉良好的决定的能力。

Gaining trust and respect from the people you work with can make it easier to influence without authority.

> 获得与你一起工作的人的信任和尊重可以使你更容易在没有权威的情况下施加影响。

If those around you trust your decision-making, they may be more likely to try to help you achieve project goals, even if you aren’t their direct manager. 

> 如果你周围的人信任你的决策，他们可能更有可能尝试帮助你实现项目目标，即使你不是他们的直接经理。



# The elements of influencing

## Steps to effective influencing

Hi again. In this video, we're going to discuss influencing the people around you. I'll describe the four steps of influencing and some common influencing mistakes. There are a few techniques that project managers can use to influence the people they work with, both within a team and beyond it. But first, what do we mean by influencing? Influencing is the ability to alter another person's thinking or behaviors. We'll discuss the concept of influencing in the context of our Plant Pals project at Office Green. Let's say that your team would like to partner with a well-known chocolate manufacturer to create a bundle deal. With this deal, the client could choose to add on a high-quality chocolate bar with each plant they purchase. You decide to send an initial email to a partnership Manager at the chocolate manufacturer to gauge their interest in the idea, and ultimately influence them to work with you. So, how do you go about writing that email that effectively influences your audience to consider your idea? Well, it turns out there are four tried and true steps of effective influencing. Leadership expert, Dr. Jay A Conger identifies the steps to effective influencing as: establish credibility, frame for common ground, provide evidence and connect emotionally. Let's discuss each step. The first step to effective influencing is to establish credibility. During this step, you make the case for why your audience should listen to you. According to Dr. Conger, credibility comes from two sources, expertise, and relationships. You need to demonstrate to your audience that you're an expert on a given topic, whether that's through professional experience, extensive research, or something else, and you need to demonstrate relationship credibility by establishing that you're honest, trustworthy, and someone who they want to work with. To establish credibility, you might kick off your Office Green email by greeting the recipient by name, then writing something like, "I'm Elita, a lead project manager at Office Green. Your colleague, Alex, passed on your contact information. Alex and I worked together to launch new services at Office Green before she joined your organization." In these opening lines, you've established expertise, credibility by introducing your role at office green and by suddenly highlighting that you've launched new services in the past. To demonstrate relationship credibility, you've established that you and the recipient have a shared contact who has worked closely with you in the past and can vouch for your trustworthiness and emotional intelligence. The second step is to frame for common ground. In this step, you'll make the case for how your idea can benefit your audience. To determine this, you'll need a strong understanding of your audience and their values. In essence, what about your idea will appeal to them, and how will they stand to benefit from agreeing to your idea? In our Office Green email, you might establish that you've researched their organization extensively and believe that this new service might align with their current offerings. For example, you might write something like this, "We're launching a service to provide top clients with desk plants and we'd like to explore a bundle offering to pair high-quality chocolate with each plant order. I've admired your organizations push in recent years to work with other lifestyle and wellness brands and I think there may be a great opportunity for us to collaborate." In this portion of the email, you've established that you've done your research on the organization and that their previous partnerships indicate that working together might be a great fit. The next step is to provide evidence. In this step, you'll make your case through hard data and persuasive storytelling. Numbers aren't strong enough on their own. They need stories to live in them up. In our Office Green email, you might appeal to your recipient with a line like, "We recently surveyed clients to gauge interest in this kind of offering, and your brand came up again and again." In this example, you provided evidence through the results of client surveys which showed overwhelmingly positive brand recognition for our shared audience. The last step is to connect emotionally. In this step, you'll demonstrate to your audience that you're emotionally committed to your idea and you'll do your best to match their emotional state. In our Office Green email, you might demonstrate an emotional connection by tapping into their brand ethos. For example, you might write something like, "We've been following your profile on Instagram and love your posts on chocolate's connection to living a well and balanced lifestyle. Perhaps we can discuss combining forces to bring this message to an even wider audience," and then you end your note with a friendly closer, something like, "If you're interested, I'd love to connect and share what our partner program is all about." To recap, establishing credibility, framing for common ground, providing evidence and connecting emotionally, are four proven, effective steps you can apply when attempting to influence others. Dr. Conger also identified four common mistakes that people make when attempting to influence others. They'll often approach their audience too aggressively, and that tends to put people off ideas entirely. They might also resist compromise, which is crucial for any kind of mutual agreement. They'll focus too much on developing their argument for the idea and not enough time establishing credibility, framing for common ground, providing evidence and connecting emotionally, and they'll assume that they can work out an agreement through just one conversation. These mistakes can jeopardize your attempts to influence others and limit your ability to build relationships, so be mindful of these common mistakes when preparing to pitch another person on your big idea. Great job. Now you know the four steps of influencing, as well as some common mistakes that people make when attempting to influence others. Coming up, you'll learn more about personal and organizational sources of influencing power. Meet you in the next video.



## Using sources of power to influence

Welcome back. Earlier, you learned how your approach can impact your ability to influence others. But influencing is about more than just your approach. In fact, so much of your ability to influence others comes from your own sources of power. Throughout your career, you'll rely on your sources of power to influence others to do great work in service of the project goals. In his book, The Elements of Power: Lessons On Leadership and Influence, the researcher Terry Bacon, determined that most power sources fall into two buckets, organizational and personal. From these power sources, we picked out the ones we feel are most important to cover here. Let's start with organizational sources of power, which include your role, information, network, and reputation. First, we have your role, which refers to your position within an organization, or team. In a project management role, you have a certain level of power over the project, and therefore more influence. Information is another source of organizational power, which refers to your level of access, and control over information. As a project manager, you possess a huge amount of information about your work, and your stakeholders, which can work to your benefit. Now it may be tempting to assume that as a leader, you have all of the answers, but to be a good influencer, you should ask questions, and consider all ideas. You may even hear new insights, and notice issues in a different way. Share information with your team regularly so that they can provide input on the full picture. You can also derive power from your network. This refers to people you're connected with professionally and personally. Strong connections within your organization and beyond it can boost your ability to influence others, and help your project continue on. If you demonstrate that you're well-connected and have a good chance of getting stakeholders support, or budget approval for your plans, then you're more likely to get your audience on your side. You should use your network to help colleagues make new connections. Your team's effectiveness will increase as you take on the responsibility of helping each person develop their skills and expand their network, which in turn increases their own influencing power. Lastly, we have reputation, which refers to how others perceive you overall. As you might expect, people with positive reputations tend to be more influential than those with negative reputations. One way I've noticed this play out is through collaboration. If you're a good collaborator, you can boost your reputation by becoming known for being easy to work with, keeping your commitments, and helping others achieve their own goals. Your role, access to and control of information, network, and reputation are important organizational sources of power to be aware of. It's also important to identify power sources that come from you. These are referred to as personal sources of power, which include knowledge, expressiveness, history and character. I like to think of these as your own personal superpowers. Knowledge refers to the power that you draw from your expertise in certain subjects, your unique abilities, and skill sets, and even your ability to learn new things. What comes to mind when you think about an influential leader? Typically, they have a lot of knowledge in their field and you're more likely to trust their opinion. When you're considering how to use your own knowledge as a source of power, reflect on the expertise you already have, and consider areas where you still want to grow and learn more. Expressiveness refers to your ability to communicate with others. This is a big one. As you learned earlier, so much of influencing comes down to how you approach your audience. Maybe you're a great storyteller, or maybe you're really good at connecting emotionally with people. Strong communication skills like these can significantly increase your ability to influence others. The next personal source of power is history. History refers to the level of personal history there is between yourself and another person. Makes sense. A strong relationship with the person you hope to influence can go a long way. As a project manager, you'll be managing team dynamics and building team relationships, which can help you build up personal history with the people around you, and finally, character. Character refers to other people's view of the qualities that make you: you. Like, honesty, integrity, kindness, and so much more. Character is a huge one, you'll derive an enormous amount of power from high estimates of your character. What personal characteristics do you value within yourself? These are the qualities that have the power to make you a strong, supportive leader for the people around you. Knowledge, expressiveness, history, and character, are just four personal sources of power, but it's important to remember that there's so much wrapped in each one of these. There's trustworthiness, authenticity, wisdom, and on and on. There's so many attributes to draw power from. I like to think of these elements as personal superpowers. I learned early on in my career that my personal superpower is knowledge, specifically my innate curiosity. When I started at Google, I didn't have a background in software engineering, but I'm a naturally curious person and I'm not afraid to ask questions. When I join a new team, I find the engineer who seems to have the most knowledge or experience, and I ask them to teach me how everything works. Most people are genuinely interested in sharing what they know. That initial chat usually leads to conversations over lunch, which helps me to build my own knowledge, and personal history with my colleague. Through these conversations, I learn about other teammates to connect with, which increases my network. As you build your career, try to identify your own superpowers. Find the combination of influencing techniques that best suits your particular circumstances. It takes practice to polish your skills, and lean into various superpowers when working with others, but if you invest time in thinking, and troubleshooting your influencing strategy, it will pay off. In the next video, we'll review and wrap up. Meet you there.



## Chris: Influencing others by demonstrating project impact

Hi, I'm Chris. I'm a Diversity Program Manager here at Google. Influencing is a huge component when it comes to program management. You might have an incredible idea about where you want a program or a project to go, and so once you have come up with all these creative ideas, and you want to convince someone to sign off on it, you have to think about what's in it for them. What's the impact that this project or program is going to have on the business, on the consumer, what have you, and so once you are able to distill what that impact is going to be, you can really think about how you're going to frame the ask to that executive stakeholder. Influencing, everyone has the ability to do it. You've done it since you were a kid, whether it be trying to go out and play with your friends or get your favorite meal from the favorite restaurant that you have. You've always tried to influence someone to give you what you want, but you have to think about what the value is for them. So different, when you're a kid, the value is only really for you. When I first came into my role as a diversity program manager, there were a set of programs that had been around for a number of years, and I came in, I had a fresh set of eyes, and I recognized that there's a lot of redundancy with the programs that we had. What I did is came in and I had to influence people that had been running those programs, that their programs were all very similar in that if we all work together, we'd be able to build just one program that solves all these needs. Now that took some time, right? I had to show examples of why I think this singular program could impact the target population in the same way I had to show how each person would have a role in this new found program, right? I couldn't just say like all of your programs need to stop. It was more so all your programs need to mature into this new identity, so it took some time. It really also took a lot of relationship massaging and maturing because I was a new guy, so I had to come in and prove myself. The impact was shown pretty soon after because it was thought through well in advance. My advice is: keep it simple. So, you have all of the background information about why this is important, all the steps it will take you to get there, but the person who you're trying to influence just needs to know when you're going to get there and basic information on how you're going to get there. And so, don't try to bring them into the weeds with you. Keep them at a point that makes sense for the audience that you're in. So if you're talking to a researcher, they might want to know the data points. So, talking to the marketing team, they want to probably know the more splashy high-level elements and the target demographics. So keep in mind your audience, but keep it simple. Influencing doesn't need to be a chore. Once you've done the work, you should be excited to talk to someone about it, and so, if you don't feel excited about the work that you're doing, I would take a step back and think about what it is that you are building, what it is that you're putting together, and if it doesn't excite you, it's not going to excite somebody else.



## Creating an effective influencing statement

Introductions in literature are important. Think of the opening lines of a good book—they help set the tone for what the reader can expect going forward. Introductions are important in project management too, especially when you are hoping to influence a stakeholder to consider and approve a new plan or idea. 

In this reading, we will help you apply techniques you can use to influence others. We will take you through the steps of creating a strong **influencing statement** that opens the conversation and sets you up for success with your audience.

**What is influencing?**

First, let’s review what it means to influence another person. **Influencing** is the ability to alter another person’s thinking or behaviors. If you have ever tried to persuade another person to understand your point of view, then you know that influencing is easier said than done.

**Conger’s four steps**

In his article, *The Necessary Art of Persuasion*, Jay A. Conger identified four steps to effectively influence another person to consider new ideas. 

As you learned earlier, those steps are: 

1. **Establish credibility**
2. **Frame for common ground**
3. **Provide evidence**
4. **Connect emotionally** 

Throughout your career in project management, there will be times when you will need to influence someone to consider an idea, approve a plan, or complete a project task. Conger’s four steps provide a useful framework for thoughtfully approaching conversations that are important to project success and influencing stakeholders. Let’s explore each step further before applying them to an influencing statement:

**1. Establish credibility**

When trying to persuade another person to listen to you, it helps to establish credibility. Ask yourself, why should this person listen to you? According to Conger, it is best to draw credibility from both expertise and relationships. 

You can build credibility by showing a level of expertise on the topic at hand. It also helps to have “a history of sound judgement.” If you find that you lack expertise on a subject, don’t worry! You can work to increase your knowledge through education or research, or you can even ask an expert for help.

You can also build credibility through strong relationships with your audience and others around you. Conger found that influential leaders tend to show their trustworthiness and willingness to do right by their colleagues over time, and in turn, people are more likely to listen to them.

**2. Frame for common ground**

The next step in effectively persuading people is to frame for common ground. You can do this by making a case for how your idea would benefit your audience, and you can determine how your ideas will benefit your audience by gaining a strong understanding of them and what they value. Pay close attention to what matters to your audience by listening carefully and gathering information during meetings and conversations. Then they frame your ideas based on your audience’s needs and interests. 

**3. Provide evidence**

The third step is to provide evidence that supports your ideas. As Conger notes, though numbers are important, the best persuaders pair numbers with vivid language**.** They share stories, examples, and metaphors to help influence their audiences. Using vivid language can help bring your figures to life and draw stakeholders’ interest to your proposal.

**4. Connect emotionally**

The fourth step is to connect emotionally with your audience. In this step, you illustrate that you are emotionally invested in the idea that you are presenting. But crucially, Conger notes, you must also do your best to determine and match the emotional state of your audience.



**Applying Conger’s steps to an influencing statement**

Conger’s four steps—establish credibility, frame for common ground, provide evidence, and connect emotionally—are meant to be applied throughout important conversations with those whom you aim to influence. But to set yourself up for success during these conversations, you can apply the four steps to the influencing statement that sets the stage for your idea. 

Let’s discuss how Conger’s four steps come together in the following example: 

Carmen is a project manager at a small marketing agency. She would like to convince a human resources director at her organization to approve a new process for onboarding new graphic design employees.

Though the company has an existing onboarding process, this process is the same for all new hires, regardless of role. As a project manager working in the human resources department, she learns that it is hard for newly-hired graphic designers to onboard since there are only a few people who hold graphic design roles at the company. Carmen identifies that there is a lack of information available for new graphic design hires to turn to for learning about procedures and software specific to their role. 

Carmen would like to propose that all new graphic design hires receive a digital welcome packet containing guidelines for installing software, processes to be aware of, and other design-specific onboarding documents. Carmen developed a similar process in her role at a previous company, and it received a positive response from employees. She thinks a similar process will work for her new organization too, so she sets up time with her director to present her idea.

To influence her director to approve the new process, Carmen opens her presentation with a strong influencing statement:

*I’d like to propose a new onboarding process for graphic design hires.* 

**(Provide evidence)** *In reviewing our new hire surveys, 80% of recent graphic design hires have assigned a negative rating to our onboarding process. When I followed up with respondents, I learned that our graphic designers lack access to relevant information that could help them acclimate to our organization faster. To address this issue, I would like to create a digital welcome packet containing design-specific onboarding documentation.*

**(Frame for common ground)** *I have met with leaders on the graphic design team to discuss this idea, and they agreed that a design-specific onboarding process might help increase the productivity of new hires, since a better onboarding process would enable them to be better prepared to take on projects in their first few weeks on the job.*

**(Establish credibility)** *In my previous role, I designed a similar, role-specific onboarding process, which increased our new hire satisfaction rates by 60%. I think a new process could benefit employees here, as well.*

**(Connect emotionally)** *It can be overwhelming to join a new company. A smoother, more personalized onboarding experience might help set the tone for the kind of support new graphic design hires can expect from our team.* 

**Key takeaway**

In this influencing statement, the project manager:

- **Provided evidence** from company surveys to set the stage for her proposal.
- **Framed for common ground** by noting how a new onboarding process might increase employee productivity.
- **Established credibility** by outlining her previous experience with launching similar processes.
- **Connected emotionally** by encouraging her audience to reflect on past experiences they may have endured as a new hire. 

By opening with a strong influencing statement, you can set yourself up for a successful conversation that is more likely to persuade your audience and achieve your goals.
