# Cultivating effective teams



## Introduction: Leadership and influencing skills

Welcome back in this module, you'll learn the value of a high functioning team and how teamwork can help you reach your project goals. We'll also take you through the different stages of team development, and you'll learn about managing team dynamics. We'll discuss motivating project team members to succeed and providing each person with personalized levels of engagement. And we'll take you through techniques you can use to influence others. Let's get started.



## The necessity of project teamwork

Think of a leader who you admire and respect. What qualities do they have that makes them a good leader?

> 想想你尊敬和钦佩的领导者。他们具备哪些品质使他们成为出色的领导者呢？

Maybe they're an active listener. Maybe they're great at fostering a sense of community for people around them.

> 也许他们是积极的倾听者。也许他们擅长营造周围人的社区感。

As a project manager, leadership is a big part of the job. But being a great project manager is about more than simply leading a team to complete a project. It's about supporting the people on your team to do their best work, and enabling people to build things they're proud of. In this video, we'll define teamwork and explain why it's important for successful project management.

> 作为项目经理，领导是工作的重要组成部分。但成为一名出色的项目经理不仅仅是领导团队完成项目。它还包括支持团队成员做出最好的工作，使他们能够构建令他们自豪的东西。在这个视频中，我们将定义团队合作，并解释为什么它对于成功的项目管理至关重要。

The best leaders are able to get people to work together. That's why a project manager's ability to develop and lead teams that work well together is so important. But before we go further, let's pause and consider, what exactly is a team? Though there are many different definitions of the word team, here's how we describe it here at Google.

> 最好的领导者能够让人们协同工作。这就是为什么项目经理开发和领导高效协同工作的团队能力如此重要的原因。但在我们进一步讨论之前，让我们暂停一下并考虑，什么是团队？虽然对于团队这个词有许多不同的定义，但这是谷歌在这里的定义。

A team is a group of people who plan, solve problems, make decisions, and review progress in service of a specific project, or objective. Team members rely on each other to get things done. For example, a software engineering team might be tasked with creating one seamless software experience that meets users' needs. Beyond coordinating with the project manager, members of the software engineering team will also coordinate with one another as they work toward their shared goal. Teams differ from workgroups, which we define as being based on organizational or managerial hierarchy. Though people within a workgroup might be working toward a common goal, their work is more likely to be coordinated, controlled, or assigned by a single person or entity. For example, a workgroup focused on quality assurance testing might be tasked with running a set of test plans. The group manager might split up that work and assign each quality assurance tester a plan to review. But unlike a team, the testers will work independently of one another to complete their tasks and will coordinate mainly with the manager and the development team of the feature they're testing. Teams and work groups each have unique benefits within a larger organization. But for the purpose of this program, we'll focus on teams. More specifically, we'll discuss how project managers develop and lead effective teams by fostering a culture of teamwork.

> 团队是一组人，他们为了特定的项目或目标进行计划、解决问题、做出决策和审查进展。团队成员依赖彼此来完成任务。例如，一个软件工程团队可能被赋予创建一个无缝的软件体验，以满足用户的需求。除了与项目经理协调之外，软件工程团队的成员还将相互协调，以实现他们共同的目标。团队与工作组不同，我们定义工作组是基于组织或管理层次结构的。虽然工作组内的人们可能在朝着一个共同的目标努力，但他们的工作更有可能是由一个人或实体协调、控制或分配的。例如，一个专注于质量保证测试的工作组可能被要求运行一组测试计划。团队经理可能会分配工作，并为每个质量保证测试员分配一个计划进行审查。但与团队不同，测试员将独立完成各自的任务，并主要与经理和他们正在测试的功能的开发团队进行协调。在较大的组织中，团队和工作组都有独特的好处。但对于这个项目的目的，我们将重点放在团队上。更具体地说，我们将讨论项目经理如何通过培养团队合作的文化来发展和领导高效的团队。

Teamwork is an effective collaborative way of working in which each person is committed to and heading toward a shared goal. Teamwork maximizes the individual strength of each team member to bring out the best in each person. As you might imagine, teamwork is a crucial part of successful project management. There are a few reasons for this. For one, teamwork fosters creativity. A team might leverage the diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences of their members to devise better solutions and build products that address more diverse user needs than they might have if they were working independently of each other. Teamwork also encourages accountability. The knowledge that the execution of your tasks directly impacts the tasks of the rest of the team can be a powerful motivator. And most importantly, teamwork helps you get stuff done. Big complex projects need smart, capable people to complete tasks and to reach milestones to meet the project goals. As the project manager, it's your job to encourage others to actively engage in working together as a team to foster creativity, encourage accountability, and to get stuff done.

> 团队合作是一种有效的协作工作方式，每个人都致力于一个共同的目标。团队合作最大程度地发挥了每个团队成员的个人优势，使每个人都能充分发挥自己的长处。正如你所能想象的，团队合作是成功的项目管理的重要组成部分。这其中

有几个原因。首先，团队合作促进创造力。一个团队可以利用其成员的多样化观点、技能和经验，制定更好的解决方案，构建满足更多不同用户需求的产品，这可能比他们独立工作时更好。团队合作还鼓励负责。知道你的任务执行直接影响到其他团队成员的任务可以是一个强大的激励因素。最重要的是，团队合作有助于你完成任务。大型复杂的项目需要聪明、有能力的人来完成任务，达到里程碑，以实现项目目标。作为项目经理，你的工作是鼓励其他人积极参与团队合作，以培养创造力，鼓励负责，以及完成任务。

Teamwork is an effective collaborative way of working, and when done right, it can positively impact both measurable team results and the team culture. Coming up, we'll take you through the elements of effective teams. Meet you there.

> 团队合作是一种有效的协作工作方式，如果做得正确，它可以积极影响可衡量的团队结果和团队文化。接下来，我们将带你了解高效团队的要素。在那里见。



## The factors that impact team effectiveness

Teams are made up of individuals, and individuals are driven by different motivators. Whether that's serving their organization, supporting their family, or simply working on projects they find interesting.

你的团队是由个体组成的，而个体受到不同的激励因素驱动。无论是为组织服务、支持家庭，还是仅仅是从事他们认为有趣的项目。

You'll need to learn about the people on your team in order to best determine how to motivate everyone at the same time. A few years ago, researchers here at Google set out to identify the dynamics of effective teams, and through this research, they identified five factors that have an impact on team effectiveness.

为了最好地确定如何同时激励每个人，你需要了解团队中的人。几年前，谷歌的研究人员着手确定有效团队的动态，通过这项研究，他们确定了影响团队效能的五个因素。

In order of importance, those five factors are: psychological safety, dependability, structure and clarity, meaning, and impact. Let's break these down.

按重要性顺序，这五个因素分别是：心理安全、可靠性、结构和清晰度、意义和影响。让我们来详细讨论这些。

Let's start with psychological safety, which is the number one factor that impacts team effectiveness.

我们先从心理安全开始，这是影响团队效能的第一因素。

Here's how our researchers define it.

以下是我们的研究人员如何定义心理安全的。

Psychological safety refers to an individual's perception of the consequences of taking interpersonal risks.

心理安全指的是个体对于采取人际风险后果的感知。

In other words, they believe it's safe to take risks within their team, and they don't risk being labeled as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or disruptive. On teams with high psychological safety, teammates feel comfortable taking risks around fellow team members, seeking differing opinions, and resolving interpersonal conflict when it comes up.

换句话说，他们认为在团队内采取风险是安全的，他们不会被贴上无知、无能、消极或破坏的标签。在拥有高度心理安全感的团队中，团队成员感到在同事面前采取风险、寻求不同意见以及在出现人际冲突时解决问题是舒适的。

For example, on my team at Google, we like to say "be direct and kind." We've worked really hard to build a team culture in which we can hold one another accountable while maintaining a shared space that is safe, secure, and peaceful.

例如，在谷歌的我的团队中，我们喜欢说“直言不讳，善待他人”。我们非常努力地建立了一个团队文化，在这个文化中，我们可以相互负责，同时保持一个安全、安心和和平的共享空间。

What I found is that when opportunities to take risks do arise, like pitching an out-of-the-box idea to my directors, for example, this culture of mutual respect has already laid the groundwork to get direct feedback without frustration or worrying that I might embarrass myself. And that's been invaluable in maintaining a high level of psychological safety for the team.

我发现的是，当采取风险的机会出现时，比如向我的主管提出一个独具特色的想法，这种相互尊重的文化已经为获取直接反馈奠定了基础，而不会感到沮丧或担心自己会出丑。这对于保持团队的高度心理安全感来说是非常宝贵的。

Next, we have dependability. Google's researchers explain it this way.

接下来，我们有可靠性。谷歌的研究人员这样解释。

On dependable teams, members are reliable and complete their work on time.

在可靠的团队上，成员是可靠的，按时完成工作。

Creating a dependable team requires the combination of setting, negotiating, and meeting expectations. Yes, your team needs to meet the expectations set for them. At the same time, you as a project manager need to establish a two-way relationship with your team.

创建一个可靠的团队需要设定、协商和满足期望的结合。是的，你的团队需要满足为他们设定的期望。与此同时，作为项目经理，你需要与你的团队建立双向关系。

You have to be able to clearly communicate expectations and ensure that the team feels comfortable negotiating with you when needed.

你必须能够清晰地传达期望，并确保团队在需要时感到舒适地与你进行协商。

For example, it's likely that a person on your team works on two or more projects with competing deadlines. If they're afraid to share their own constraints with you, then their work on both projects might suffer. Alternatively, if they come to you with their concerns and open understanding and negotiation around priorities could help ease their burden.

例如，你的团队中可能有一个人在两个或更多的项目上工作，这些项目有竞争性的截止日期。如果他们害怕与你分享自己的限制，那么他们在两个项目上的工作可能会受到影响。或者，如果他们来找你谈谈他们的顾虑，并在优先事项周围进行开放的理解和协商，可以帮助减轻他们的负担。

Next, we have structure and clarity.

接下来，我们有结构和清晰度。

Here's how our researchers define it.

以下是我们的研究人员如何定义结构和清晰度的。

Structure and clarity refers to an individual's understanding of job expectations, knowledge of how to meet those expectations, and the consequences of their performance.

结构和清晰度是指个体对工作期望的理解，对如何满足这些期望的知识，以及他们绩效的后果。

Each team member has a clear sense of their individual role, plans, and goals, and they have a sense of how their work affects the group.

每个团队成员都清楚地知道自己的个人角色、计划和目标，他们知道自巴特尔公司工作如何影响团队。

You as the project manager can help foster a sense of structure and clarity on the team. For example, if project structure and tracking are sloppy, unorganized, and incohesive, then the team's output is likely to be sloppy, unorganized, and incohesive. This can cause tension within the team.

作为项目经理，你可以帮助团队建立结构和清晰度的感觉。例如，如果项目结构和跟踪混乱、无组织、不协调，那么团队的产出很可能也是混乱、无组织、不协调的。这可能会在团队内部引起紧张。

Alternatively, if you diligently engage in project tracking, your team will have clarity, feel more united, and will be able to effectively collaborate.

或者，如果你努力参与项目跟踪，你的团队将会更加明了，感到更加团结，将能够有效地合作。

Meaning also impacts team effectiveness. Google's researchers defined meaning in this context as finding a sense of purpose either in the work itself or in the results of that work. For example, your teammates might find meaning in supporting themselves financially, helping the team reach its goals, or wanting their products to reach a new community of users.

意义也影响团队的效益。谷歌的研究人员在这个背景下定义了意义，即在工作本身或工作结果中找到目标感。例如，你的团队成员可能会在经济上支持自己，帮助团队实现目标，或者希望他们的产品能够达到新的用户群体。

And finally, we have impact. Our researchers define impact as the belief that the results of one's work matters and creates change. It can be challenging for people to notice how their work can shift an entire ecosystem forward. Part of your role as the project manager is to help individual teammates identify how they drive impact both within the team and beyond it. Project tracking can be a helpful tool for visualizing progress and impact.

最后，我们有影响力。我们的研究人员将影响定义为一种相信自己的工作结果重要且能够产生改变的信念。人们很难注意到他们的工作如何能够推动整个生态系统向前发展。作为项目经理的一部分，你的角色之一是帮助个体团队成员确定他们如何在团队内部和团队之外产生影响。项目跟踪可以是可视化进度和影响的有用工具。

Meeting milestones, for example, demonstrates to the team how their individual tasks contribute to the larger project goals. For example, my team focuses on routing within Google Maps. The big idea is to focus on helping people get to where they're going on time. So, everything we do should make that experience incrementally better. And that's how we add impact.

例如，达到里程碑表明了团队如何个体任务对更大的项目目标产生贡献。例如，我的团队专注于谷歌地图中的路径规划。我们的大想法是专注于帮助人们准时到达目的地。所以，我们所做的一切都应该使这一体验逐步变得更好。这就是我们如何产生影响的方式。

To recap, Google's researchers identified psychological safety, dependability, structure and clarity, meaning, and impact as the top five factors that have an impact on team effectiveness. Coming up, we'll discuss how project managers lead teams that reach project goals.

总之，谷歌的研究人员确定了心理安全、可靠性、结构和清晰度、意义和影响作为影响团队效能的五个最重要因素。接下来，我们将讨论项目经理如何领导团队实现项目目标。



# Effective project leadership

## Leading high-functioning teams

Hi again, there are a few key ways that project managers help build high-functioning teams who work together to meet project goals.

嗨，再次见面，项目经理在帮助构建高效团队以共同实现项目目标方面有一些关键方法。

They create systems that turn chaos into order;

他们创建将混乱转化为秩序的系统；

They communicate and listen;

他们进行沟通并倾听；

They promote trust and psychological safety;

他们促进信任和心理安全；

They demonstrate empathy and create motivation;

他们表现出同情并激发动力；

They delegate responsibility and prioritize;

他们委派责任并确定优先级；

And they celebrate the team's success.

他们庆祝团队的成功。

Let's go through each of those points one by one.

让我们逐一讨论这些要点。

Good project managers lead their teams by creating systems that turn chaos into order.

优秀的项目经理通过创建将混乱转化为秩序的系统来引导他们的团队。

You can do this by creating, implementing, and improving: standardize, measurable, repeatable and scalable workflows and processes for your team.

您可以通过为您的团队创建、实施和改进标准化、可衡量、可重复和可扩展的工作流程和流程来做到这一点。

For example, if you find that you're usually chasing down teammates for progress on their work, you might set up a process for how and when a teammate should let you know that they've completed a task.

例如，如果您通常需要追踪队友的工作进展，您可以建立一个流程，规定队友应该如何以及何时通知您他们已完成了任务。

Think of creating systems as a kind of connect the dots puzzle. Being a project manager is sort of like that, but there are no numbers, just dots and a partial image.

将创建系统想象成一种连接点的拼图。成为一个项目经理有点像这样，但没有数字，只有点和部分图像。

But we don't need the numbers. We can notice the dots, know their importance and string them together to help everyone visualize the project as a whole.

但我们不需要数字。我们可以注意到这些点，了解它们的重要性，并将它们串在一起，帮助每个人将整个项目视觉化。

You find the system through the chaos and help other people to find it, too.

您通过混乱找到系统，并帮助其他人也找到它。

Another way that project managers lead is through communicating and listening.

项目经理领导的另一种方式是通过沟通和倾听。

As the project manager, it's your job to ensure that everyone on your team is on the same page regarding the status of your project.

作为项目经理，您的工作是确保您团队的每个人对项目的状态达成一致。

For example, you might communicate with the team via daily or weekly status update emails and regular team meetings.

例如，您可以通过每日或每周的状态更新电子邮件和定期团队会议与团队进行沟通。

Team meetings also provide a space for listening, whether you're gathering feedback on a workflow or process, or fielding questions from the group.

团队会议还提供了倾听的空间，无论您是收集工作流程或流程的反馈，还是回答团队的问题。

You can also solicit feedback or questions via status update emails, since some people might feel more comfortable speaking in private.

您还可以通过状态更新电子邮件征求反馈或提问，因为有些人可能在私下更愿意发表意见。

In addition to communicating and listening to the wider team, it's also your responsibility to regularly connect with individual teammates.

除了与整个团队进行沟通和倾听之外，您还有责任定期与个别队友联系。

You do this by gaining an understanding of communication styles and by asking people on your team how they prefer to communicate.

您可以通过了解沟通风格，以及向您团队中的人询问他们如何更喜欢沟通来做到这一点。

What's important to know is that everyone communicates differently. For example, I might make small talk with colleagues who I know enjoy it. Or I might get straight to the point with colleagues who prefer not to chat.

重要的是要知道，每个人的沟通方式都不同。例如，我可能会和我知道喜欢聊天的同事寒暄一下。或者我可能会直接与那些不喜欢聊天的同事开门见山。

Project managers also lead by promoting trust and psychological safety within their team.

项目经理还通过促进团队内部的信任和心理安全来领导。

As a reminder, psychological safety refers to an individual's perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk.

提醒一下，心理安全是指个体对承担人际风险后果的感知。

Team members need to trust that they're safe and speaking up if they have feedback or concerns about the project as a whole or about their individual tasks.

团队成员需要相信，如果他们对整个项目或个人任务有反馈或担忧，他们是安全的，可以说出来。

It's your job to create a team atmosphere where different opinions are welcome, and all members remain respectful of one another during challenging conversations.

您的任务是创建一个团队氛围，不同的意见受到欢迎，在具有挑战性的对话期间，所有成员都彼此保持尊重。

For example, during weekly status meetings, you might schedule time for open, thoughtful and inclusive discussions. You might model this by asking for help solving a problem that's impacting the team. You should encourage contributions from all team members regardless of role or rank. By doing this, you make clear to your teammates that they should feel comfortable challenging processes and workflows. And you make clear that critiques of the project and plans are welcomed and valued no matter who they come from. While it can feel challenging to provide and accept feedback, it's a healthy part of project management and usually makes for a better project outcome.

例如，在每周状态会议期间，您可以安排时间进行开放、深思熟虑和包容的讨论。您可以通过寻求帮助解决影响团队的问题来模拟这一点。您应鼓励所有团队成员，无论其角色或级别如何，都可以贡献意见。通过这样做，您向您的队友明确表示，他们应该感到自在地挑战流程和工作流程。并且明确表示，项目和计划的批评都受欢迎和受重视，不管批评来自谁。尽管提供和接受反馈可能会感到具有挑战性，但这是项目管理中的健康部分，通常会带来更好的项目结果。

On an individual level, project managers lead by practicing empathy and creating motivation for their team members. It's possible you've heard the phrase, "there's no I in team," and while that's true that teams need to work together to be effective, it's also important to remember that teams are made up of individuals with differing motivations and lives outside of work. You can demonstrate empathy for your teammates by being present, listening, and asking questions. During one on one conversations, avoid making assumptions about what the other person is thinking and feeling. If you're quiet and curious, there's always more to learn.

在个体层面上，项目经理通过实践同情和为团队成员创造动力来领导。您可能听过短语“团队中没有我”的说法，尽管这是正确的，即团队需要共同合作才能有效，但也重要的是记住，团队是由拥有不同动机和工作之外生活的个体组成的。您可以通过在场、倾听和提问来向您的队友表现同情。在一对一的对话中，避免假设对方在思考和感受什么。如果您安静而充满好奇心，总是有更多可以学习的。

In addition to showing empathy for my team, I also like to create motivation by recognizing a job well done through public forums. Like in a meeting or a group email.

除了向我的团队表现同情之外，我还喜欢通过公开的论坛来表彰出色的工作，比如在会议中或者群体电子邮件中。

Recognition tells people that they're doing the right things, and motivates them to keep up the good work. Be sure to recognize good work, and not just heroic efforts.

认可告诉人们他们正在做正确的事情，并激励他们继续保持良好的工作。务必认可出色的工作，而不仅仅是英雄式的努力。

Project managers also lead by delegating responsibility and prioritizing.

项目经理还通过委派责任和确定优先级来领导。

Most projects will likely have multiple tasks taking place simultaneously. And it's your job to keep the team focused and heading toward the project goals and deliverables. By delegating responsibility for specific tasks to individuals on your team, you provide your teammates with the opportunity to add value using their particular set of skills. You also give yourself space to focus on the project as a whole.

大多数项目可能会同时进行多个任务。而您的工作是让团队保持专注，并朝着项目目标和可交付成果前进。通过将特定任务的责任委派给团队中的个人，您为队友提供了利用其特定技能集增加价值的机会。同时，您也给自己留出了关注整个项目的空间。

By prioritizing tasks, you reduce ambiguity and provide clarity for your team. If you think that a task is important, but your team doesn't, they might work on whatever tasks they like. By prioritizing and making that prioritization known, you keep the team focused. Work with your team to build consensus around priorities, explaining your rationale can help you get their buy-in and increase their commitment to the work. Lastly, project managers lead by celebrating team success, both at the end of the project and throughout it. This includes celebrating big and small wins like reaching a milestone or receiving positive feedback from stakeholders. Celebrating success is an important tool for motivating the team because it increases morale and boosts the team's engagement.

通过确定任务的优先级，您减少了模糊性，为您的团队提供了清晰度。如果您认为某个任务很重要，但您的团队不这么认为，他们可能会选择做他们喜欢的任务。通过确定优先级并让其众所周知，您可以使团队保持专注。与您的团队一起建立有关优先事项的共识，解释您的理由可以帮助您获得他们的支持，增加他们对工作的承诺。最后，项目经理通过庆祝团队的成功来领导，无论是在项目结束时还是在项目进行中。这包括庆祝达到里程碑或从利益相关者那里获得积极反馈等大小胜利。庆祝成功是激励团队的重要工具，因为它提高了士气并增强了团队的参与度。

To recap, project managers build high-functioning teams in a few key ways: creating systems that turn chaos into order; communicating and listening; promoting trust and psychological safety; demonstrating empathy and creating

 motivation; delegating responsibility and prioritizing; and celebrating team success. As you grow in your career, you'll strengthen your ability to lead bigger and more complex teams, but the principles of teamwork will remain the same. Coming up, you'll learn about the stages of team development and how to manage team dynamics. I'll see you soon.

总结一下，项目经理以一些关键方法建立高效团队：创建将混乱转化为秩序的系统；进行沟通和倾听；促进信任和心理安全；展现同情并激发动力；委派责任和确定优先级；以及庆祝团队的成功。随着您在职业生涯中的成长，您将增强领导更大和更复杂团队的能力，但团队合作的原则将保持不变。接下来，您将了解团队发展的阶段以及如何管理团队动态。我会很快见到您。



## Providing “air cover” to your team

As you have learned so far, project managers build teams that meet project goals in many different ways, from delegating responsibility and prioritizing tasks to promoting trust and psychological safety. 

But there is another skill great project managers have that we will cover in this reading: the ability to provide **air cover** to protect their team. Air cover refers to support for and protection of a team in the face of out-of-scope requests or criticism from leadership. 

**What is air cover?**

A lot of what we have covered throughout this program has focused on leading and managing a project team. Much of project management involves overseeing the work of others, but it also involves managing the needs and expectations of those above you. Those people are your stakeholders, project sponsors, and other leaders within your organization. 

Though the needs and requests of your stakeholders are crucial to the project’s success, there may come a time when you will need to prioritize the needs of your team over the wants of your stakeholders. This is called providing “air cover” for your team, and it is an important part of managing a project. The ability to effectively provide air cover requires a trusting relationship between a project manager and their stakeholders. In this relationship, the project manager aims to demonstrate their abilities to lead a team and communicate effectively. 

There is some risk involved in providing air cover. Sometimes a project manager provides air cover and the project team is still unable to deliver on the goals of the project. In this case, stakeholders may question the project manager’s ability to complete projects successfully. So, when preparing to defend your team against out-of-scope requests, be sure that you are confident in your team’s progress toward the project goal.

**Providing air cover: A case study**

Imagine, for example, that you are a project manager for a brand of coffee sold in supermarkets throughout your region. You and your team have been tasked with launching three new flavors of ground coffee: vanilla, hazelnut, and mocha. 



![Image of three bags of coffee: one vanilla, one hazelnut and one mocha](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qaYHa1csRgumB2tXLMYLtg_c83c7eb803f04c8e8979b49872de6ace_C4M4L2R1.png?expiry=1699142400000&hmac=1VVY-eQTs-Gw47_XqBnDDk0SXB_COp1OLwRAm-K19yw)

However, well into the execution phase, your project sponsor sets a meeting with you to make an out-of-scope request: They would like to add a caramel-flavored coffee to the product lineup. Your team is already at maximum capacity preparing to launch the agreed-upon flavors, and a fourth flavor would add an unreasonable amount of work and stress to your very busy team.

Let’s discuss how you might provide air cover for your team in a situation like this one.

**Saying “No” without explicitly saying “No”**

One way to provide air cover to your team is to say “no” to your sponsor’s request without *explicitly* saying “no.” 

There are a few ways to do this:

- You can gently push back with a polite explanation that their request won’t be possible to complete under the current constraints—the scope, time, and/or cost—of the project. 
- You can politely offer to get back to the stakeholder with your response. This gives you time to better understand the request and to consult with trusted team members to lay out the benefits and costs of this request. And, if you are lucky, this might even give the stakeholder the opportunity to reconsider their request or forget about it entirely.

Whether you choose to push back immediately or get back to your stakeholder with your response, it is crucial to offer alternative solutions. Maybe the project timeline can expand to accommodate the request. Or maybe you and your team have a strong relationship with another team at the organization that can help fulfill the request. Whatever the alternative, brainstorming other options can help soften the blow and provide stakeholders with new ideas.

For example, you consider telling your sponsor that the current project timeline will only allow for the launch of three new coffee flavors, and that the launch of a fourth flavor would only be possible by pushing the launch date back by two months. If you were to respond to your sponsor in this way, you would be both gently refusing their request and offering them an alternative that could work for your team.

While a simple “no” response might frustrate the person making the request, gentle pushback paired with alternative options can protect your team from new work while preserving your professional relationship with stakeholders. If your stakeholders trust your leadership abilities and perspective, then they will be more likely to accept your pushback and alternative solutions.

**Intervening from behind the scenes**

Another way project managers provide air cover for their teams is to master the challenge of delicately intervening from behind the scenes when a stakeholder is making unrealistic requests or offering unreasonable critiques. 

Continuing with our coffee company example, you know how hard your team has been working to launch the new products. To avoid causing the extra stress that might come with the knowledge that the stakeholder wants to increase their workload, you avoid sharing this request with your entire project team.

This doesn’t mean you need to come up with a solution all by yourself, however. Instead of calling a team meeting to discuss the stakeholder’s request for a new flavor, you consult with only two trusted members of your team to help brainstorm solutions. One of these team members mentions that they know two new flavors are slated to be added to the fall product lineup in six months, and that perhaps the caramel flavor could be launched then instead of with the current group. This would give your team more time to work on developing the product while still fulfilling the stakeholder’s request. 

Ultimately, you bring the suggestions of adding the flavor to the fall product lineup or pushing back the launch date of the current lineup to the project sponsor, and they accept your solution to launch the new flavor in the fall.

Managing the expectations of your stakeholder while looping in relevant teammates on a need-to-know basis was essential here. This allowed your team to focus on their work without the possibility of an increased workload or an unnecessary distraction.

**Key takeaway**

Providing air cover for your team takes practice. It requires a careful balance of the needs of your stakeholders and the needs of your project team. As you become more experienced in leading projects, you will develop a stronger sense of how to manage nuanced situations like these and provide the air cover your team needs to do their best work.

我来自加利福尼亚州橙县。

My mom was a school teacher for the majority of my life.
我母亲大部分时间都是一名学校教师。

She also went on to be assistant principal and then became a principal herself.
她后来成为了一名副校长，然后自己成为了一名校长。

Because it allows me to make sure that people feel like they can get things done, but it's not just for me, it's for a collective vision.
因为它让我确保人们感到他们可以完成任务，但这不仅仅是为了我自己，而是为了一个共同的愿景。

And the advice was deference gives you the experience to be able to lead.
而那个建议是尊重给予你领导的经验。

And it's important because as a project manager, as we've said in these courses, you're not going to know or you're not going to have a lot of the technical or specific domain expertise that you need in order to create the big meaty things that you're trying to drive.
这很重要，因为作为项目经理，正如我们在这些课程中所说，你不会知道或者说你不会拥有你需要的技术或特定领域的专业知识，以便创造你试图推动的重要项目。

But as a program or a project manager, you're kind of the leader who's supposed to be making sure things get done, and you work with every little piece of the pie.
但作为一个项目或项目经理，你是那个应该确保事情得到解决的领导，你与每一个小细节一起工作。

So like my mom, who was a principal worked with the custodial staff. She worked with the PTA, she worked with the teachers, and the teachers union, she worked with the parents.
就像我母亲一样，她作为一名校长与保洁人员合作。她与家长会一起工作，与教师和教师工会一起工作，与家长一起工作。

And she developed this great network of people that helped her get things done.
她建立了一个伟大的人际网络，帮助她完成工作。

So, I would say that was the best advice that I've received.
所以，我可以说这是我收到的最好的建议。

## Team development and managing team dynamics

Imagine that you're starting a new project with a brand new team of people. No one on the team has worked together before, so this will be a new experience for everyone.

To better understand how your team might develop over time, let's discuss the psychologist Bruce Tuckman's five stages of team development. Forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning. These stages of development illustrate how teams grow from a disparate group of people into a high functioning unit.

You might even recognize the characteristics of each stage from previous experiences working on a team. Tuchman's first stage of team development is the forming stage. At this point everything feels shiny and new. Individuals on the team are just getting to know on another, and they're eager to make a good impression. And typically they're excited for the work to begin. During this stage, you as a project manager should clarify project goals, roles, and context about the project. People are seeking guidance and it's your job to provide that guidance. The second stage of team development is the storming stage, this is where things get a bit trickier. As people settle into their roles and the work on their project begins, the people on your team are interacting more and maybe disagreeing a bit. This is where feelings of frustration might emerge. Individuals might take issues with certain processes they feel are inefficient, or other teammates they disagree with, especially when the team is navigating tasks that are much more complex than they first appeared. It makes sense, right? If you're working closely with a new group of people for the first time, there's bound to be some interpersonal conflict. Teammates might disagree on time, and effort estimations, vary in their levels of independence, or prefer to prioritize certain tasks over other equally important tasks. As the project manager, it's your job to focus on conflict resolution. Listen as the team addresses problems to solve and share insights on how the team might better function as a unit.

After storming comes Tuchman's third stage, the norming stage. At this point, the team has resolved some of its internal conflict by establishing new norms. Like processes and workflows that make it easier for everyone to get things done. The team feels better equipped to work together efficiently and effectively. You, as the project manager should codify the team norms, ensuring that the team is aware of those norms and reinforce them when needed. For example, if you've agreed to discuss solutions to issues during weekly team meetings, ensure that your weekly agenda budgets time for this topic each week. Tuchman's fourth stage is the performing stage. During this time, the team works together relatively seamlessly to complete tasks, reach milestones and make progress toward the project goal. In the performing stage, you as the project manager should focus on delegating, motivating and providing feedback to keep up the team's momentum. The fifth and final stage of team development is the adjourning stage. In this stage the project is wrapping up and it's time for the team to disband. It can be a bittersweet time for the team and you might want to mark the end of the project with a celebration.

You as the project manager should set up time to celebrate the final milestones and success of the project as a group. And be sure each member of your team knows what's next for them. Okay, to recap, Tuckman's five stages of team development are forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning. These stages of team development come together to form a helpful framework you can use to assess and recognize team dynamics, and then adjust your management style accordingly. Team dynamics refer to the forces both conscious and unconscious, that impact team behavior and performance.

Managing team dynamics is a big part of determining how to motivate your team. It might be tempting to assume that people can go full-speed ahead into a project. But in reality, it's important to take time to understand the dynamics of your team overall and how individual team members are fitting in. This is especially important during the more precarious forming and storming stages.

Let's break down why managing team dynamics is so important. First, teams have individuals with different skill sets, varying degrees of autonomy, and competing priorities.

It's your job to forge consensus and set clear purposes, goals, dependencies and accountability. When teams function cohesively, they can focus on the tasks and objectives at hand. Another reason why it's important to manage team dynamics is that it helps you to create a collaborative and psychologically safe environment. When team members feel safe, they're willing to help one another, and accept help when they need it. This benefits the entire project by keeping schedules on track. Though it can take time to get to the performing stage, using the norming stage as a time to foster a collaborative environment can help you get there quicker.

Understanding and managing team dynamics can also help you understand how to motivate your team. Motivated team members are likely to contribute more to discussions, complete their tasks and actively participate in other project activities. A positive team atmosphere can help employees feel empowered. More comfortable taking calculated risks, and more likely to seek out innovative solutions to complex problems. Remember, so much of team dynamics happens under the surface. Identifying and understanding the stages of team development can help you make sense of how dynamics are playing out on your team.

This can help you to be a better leader.

Coming up, we'll discuss what it means to promote ethical and inclusive leadership in the workplace. Meet you there.



## Rowena: Delegating the details

Hi. I'm Rowena, a Senior Program Manager in the Systems Productivity and Reporting Team in Google Cloud. As a project manager, you'll find that you're not actually the direct manager of people in their roles. The key soft skill to have here is around influence; influencing without authority. It's the ability to be able to communicate with people and make sure that they understand your goals and objectives and take them along on a shared vision and shared journey. When I first became a project manager, one of the mistakes that I often made was trying to do everything for myself and not asking for help. Over the course of the last couple of years, I've really learned how to delegate and work with others as part of a team to make sure that I'm effectively managing a project as a project manager regardless of whether I have management or authority over the project team, and allowing those SMEs to really do what they're really good at. Delegating for me in my day-to-day role looks like this: I try to find subject matter experts or people that really enjoy doing a specific something that may not actually be their role. One of the best pieces of advice I ever got from a mentor was around finding people in the organization that enjoy doing something and delegating your work to them. That way you can focus on overall project or program management without having to get bogged down in the weeds by certain details that actually you might not enjoy doing or someone else really enjoys doing. Psychological safety is really important in teams because it brings diversity of thought to the table. One thing that I'm really working on is making sure that we practice inclusive meetings. An example of that could be in a meeting if you notice that one or two participants are usually quiet or don't speak up, try to encourage them to be a part of the conversation. Even better, have a coffee with them before and ask them what they think of the upcoming topic. Encourage them to bring those ideas to the table. Having diversity of thought in the room is so important. Otherwise, you're going to end up with one person in the room constantly just bringing their thoughts and ideas to the table. That's not very diverse. One thing with psychological safety is this partnership with mentorship and sponsorship. To delegate, I make sure that I sponsor people. I make sure that I showcase their best quality work across the whole project team. It's really important for morale. On the other side with mentorship, if there's a junior team member on a team that maybe doesn't have the experience or isn't as confident speaking up, I usually delegate smaller tasks to them to build up their confidence or delegate something that they might actually consider to be fun that's not in their normal day-to-day work. Finding those unique balances is the best way to delegate and prioritize.



## Ethical and inclusive leadership

Welcome back. Leading a project team comes with the responsibility to create a psychologically safe environment for the people around you. Through ethical and inclusive leadership, you can create a team culture that works for everyone and motivates the people around you to do their best work.

In this video, you'll learn the definitions of ethical and inclusive leadership. You'll also learn about the importance of fostering a culture of respect, creating equal opportunity to succeed, and ways to invite and integrate diverse perspectives.

So what do ethical and inclusive leadership entail in a team and organization? Let's start with ethical leadership. Ethical leadership is a form of leadership that promotes and values honesty, justice, respect, community and integrity. You promote ethical leadership by defining and aligning values within your team and demonstrating how adhering to those values benefits the mission of the organization.

For an example of this, consider how work culture has evolved in recent years. Around the world, employees working for organizations of all kinds have been calling on their employers to adopt ethical policy changes and to state their positions on current events.

Companies can demonstrate ethical leadership by creating forums where employees can raise their viewpoints, be heard and receive follow-ups from company leaders on employee concerns. Ethical leadership is closely tied to inclusive leadership. If ethical leadership's aim is to create forums where employees' concerns can be heard, inclusive leadership aims to put what we've heard into action to create an environment that encourages. And empowers each and every member of our community. That in turn leads to more innovation and better solutions. Here's how we think about inclusion here at Google. Inclusive leadership is when everyone's unique identity, background and experiences are respected, valued and integrated into how the team operates. These differences improve the team culture, collaboration, innovation and output. Inclusive leadership is related to diversity in that diversity is the set of differences each of us possesses, whether visible or invisible that gives us each a unique perspective on the world and our work. Inclusion is what the team does with that diversity of thought and perspective.

At Google, we've identified three ways that managers can lead inclusively. These include fostering a culture of respect, creating equal opportunity to succeed and inviting and integrating diverse perspectives. To foster a culture of respect, it's your job as a project manager to serve as a role model, set the tone for the team and take action when needed. That means modeling the values of your organization, taking appropriate action if misconduct occurs. Creating an environment in which team members feel comfortable speaking up with concerns, and recognizing team contributions regularly. To create equal opportunity to succeed, you should ensure that each person on the team has access to the information and resources they need to do their best work. You do this through regular communication, accessible documentation, and regular check-ins with the team to listen, share information, ask and answer questions and provide support. As a project manager, you're in the perfect spot to identify work that might be a good fit for a person who really wants it, but who shies away from asking for it. Knowing an individual's aspirations will help you highlight these opportunities. Finally, to invite and integrate diverse perspectives, it's your role to cultivate a culture in which each team member's perspective can be openly shared, heard and integrated into work related decisions. You do this by creating a sense of psychological safety on the team and by inviting teammates to share their thoughts, ideas and concerns, regardless of their role or rank on the team.

Developing ethical and inclusive leadership skills requires regular practice. So whether you're leading a project team of two, or 20, or 200, you should be diligent in building up your inclusive leadership skill set by creating an environment in which your team feels safe, heard and valued.

You can do this by fostering a culture of respect, creating equal opportunity to succeed and inviting and integrating diverse perspectives.

In the next lesson, we'll discuss the fundamentals of influencing, as well as some common mistakes that people make when attempting to influence others. Meet you in the next video.



## A framework for ethical decision-making

**Ethical leadership** is a form of leadership that promotes and values honesty, justice, respect, community, and integrity. As the leader of a project team, you will be expected to help your team succeed by leading with ethics. Building respect and trust with the teams you work with—from individuals to external partners to project stakeholders—begins with practicing ethical conduct. 

In this reading, you’ll gain an understanding of a common framework for ethical decision-making that can help you ensure your actions align with the ethical standards of your organization.



**Ethics within your organization**

**Ethics** can be defined as the principles of conduct governing an individual or a group. However, there is no single, universally-accepted grouping of ethical standards—these definitions differ based on the culture and community at your company. In the working world, ethical standards may differ based on profession, industry, and organization. Usually, an organization will have its own code of conduct which specifies the standards to which it holds its employees accountable. 

Here at Google, our code of conduct makes clear the expectations that we have for our employees and board members. It is possible that the organizations you will join throughout your career will have codes of conduct, too. 

Part of the challenge of leading with ethics is ensuring that your actions align with the ethical standards of your community, both within your organization and beyond it. In your role as a project manager, a clear framework for ethical decision-making can help guide you to make positive decisions throughout your project.

**A common framework for ethical decision-making**

The [Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/) developed the following framework as a helpful guide for ethical decision-making. 



![Recognize an ethical issue, get the facts, evaluate alternative actions, make a decision and test it, act and reflect](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GnrMg7bXQn-6zIO21yJ_Mg_badec93bcdfa4154ab15f85048d98951_Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-12.26.12-PM.png?expiry=1699142400000&hmac=TbzU4j7MQh1TmJ6qClcTaC604BN--m3b4xL9I5LRc3I)

**Recognize an ethical issue**

According to this framework, you can begin to question the ethics of an issue by asking yourself questions about the nature of the issue. Could your decision negatively impact another person or group of people? Does the issue go beyond what is legal or efficient? From there, you can proceed onto fact gathering.

- **Example**: A vendor you have worked with in the past sends you a generous holiday gift shortly before you are about to select a vendor for a particular task in your project. If you accept the gift, would others be negatively impacted? To determine the answer to this question, get more facts.

**Get the facts**

Decide what you should do about the issue, and seek answers as needed. Consult with the right people to consider all of the options available to you.

- **Example**: Continuing with the example above, you should check to see if your company has ethics guidelines regarding accepting gifts from external parties. If not, consult with your HR representative about the matter.

**Evaluate alternative actions**

You can evaluate alternative actions by asking yourself the following questions:

- “Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm?”
- “Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake?” 
- “Which option treats people equally or proportionally?”
- “Which option best serves the community as a whole, not just some members?”
- “Which option leads me to act as the sort of person I want to be?”

Note that your answers to these questions are subjective, and you may want to elicit the opinion of others before deciding on an alternative action.

- **Example**: In the case of the vendor gift example, the answer to the question “Which option treats people equally or proportionally?” might be “decline the gift,” given that accepting it might influence your decision about who to award the contract to.

**Make a decision and test it**

Once you have chosen an option, test it by imagining the reaction to your choice from a person whose opinion you value. 

- **Example**: Once you have decided to decline the gift, discuss your decision with your manager, HR representative, or a trusted colleague.

**Act and reflect on the outcome**

Consider how to carry out your decision with thoughtfulness and care, and after you act, consider the results of your decision.

- **Example**: Respectfully decline the vendor’s gift, noting your reason (for example, your company’s ethical guidelines state that employees are not permitted to accept gifts valued at more than $20 from vendors or contractors).

**Key takeaway** 

A framework like this one can help you feel better-equipped to make ethical decisions regarding your project and team, which is a central component of ethical leadership.

Like so much of project management, ethical leadership takes diligence and practice, and it is crucial to build this skill. As you become more comfortable leading project teams, you will strengthen your ability to make decisions that you can feel good about. Gaining trust and respect from the people you work with can make it easier to influence without authority. If those around you trust your decision-making, they may be more likely to try to help you achieve project goals, even if you aren’t their direct manager.
