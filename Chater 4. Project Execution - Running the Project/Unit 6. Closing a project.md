## Introduction: Closing a project

Welcome to our new module. Here, we'll be learning about how to close a project. In this set of videos, you'll learn to explain why closing a project is important, determine when a project is complete, and outline the project closing process. We'll learn that closing serves as an integral aspect of the project and helps avoid unfavorable scenarios. We'll also learn that completing a project and closing a project are two very different things. We'll talk about how your stakeholders and clients fit into the closing process. We'll cover how your team can help you close a project and how you can use retrospective meetings to improve your procedures and processes. We've touched on retrospectives a bit in the previous module, but you'll learn about them here in a new context. You will also learn that a project isn't fully closed until you've celebrated your team for a job well done. Then, we'll explore how the closing process works specifically for you as a project manager. We'll learn what kinds of presentations and documentation are required for project managers to properly close the project. There's a lot to cover, so let's start with an overview of the closing process. Meet me in the next video.



## The importance of project closure

Welcome back. In this video, we're going to discuss project closing. We'll answer the questions, what does project closing mean, why is it important, and when does it occur? Project closing consists of the process performed to formally complete the project, the current phase, and contractual obligations. The first thing you should know is that completing a project is not the same thing as closing a project. Just because a project is done doesn't mean it's closed. In a restaurant, just because you've ordered your meal and finished it, doesn't mean your dining experience is over. You have to pay the bill before you leave. It's the same idea with projects. What does it actually take for a project to be closed? There are three criteria that make up a project closing. You'll want to assure all work is done. Ensure that the agreed upon project management processes are executed and get formal recognition from stakeholders that the project is done. First, you must assure all work is done. There's a chance one of your tasks may have been overlooked. Let's say there was a change made that called for reprioritizing work during the project. For instance, when your team completed user acceptance testing for Project Plant Pals, everything was finished and wrapped up. But months later, a customer searches for allergy information about the plants on Office Green's site, but that information is nowhere to be found. If you did a review before wrapping the project, you might have found that this task, creating allergy documentation, was overlooked and therefore not completed. In doing a review of the project, you double- and triple-check that all work is done to avoid having to revisit the project later on. Next, you must ensure that all agreed upon project management processes are executed. Sometimes, managerial tasks get overlooked. If the task itself is finished, the procedural or administrative work that needs to take place afterwards might slip your mind. An example might be getting contracts signed and processed. It might have been months since the project was completed, but when you revisit the contract with your plant provider, you realize that neither of you ended up actually signing it. This is a crucial misstep that leaves both parties vulnerable, and it's now taking place way after the new services official launch. Finally, you'll need formal recognition and agreement that the project is complete by key stakeholders. If you don't have formal approval from all stakeholders that a project is over, certain stakeholders may still request adjustments to the project because they'll think it's still active. This may affect various members of your team. For instance, if Office Green's contracted web developers believe that the project is still active, they may still be dedicating time and even billing hours of work on this project, which means wasted money for Office Green. In the same way that all of the previous phases of the process, like initiation, planning, executing, monitoring, and controlling serve a purpose, closing serves its own, equally important purpose. Closing a project is important because it ensures that nothing has fallen through the cracks. If a project isn't closed, your team's efforts, time, and credibility may be negatively impacted. To avoid negative impacts to your team, there are a couple of different types of projects that you'll want to know about and avoid. These are the never-ending project and the abandoned project. The never-ending project exists when, for whatever reason, the project deliverables and tasks cannot be completed. This may occur when tasks are delegated to team members who don't have the skills necessary to complete the tasks or when deadlines aren't properly communicated, maybe when user acceptance testing yields too many non-launch blocking bugs, or when your client is unsatisfied, despite meeting their requirements. Pay special attention to protecting the scope of your project, and you're much more likely to close a project successfully. If it feels like the customer wants much more from you than this project is slated to deliver, maybe the best option is to commit to a follow-up project and close the current one. The abandoned project exists when inadequate handoff of the project deliverables occurs. Basically, the final deliverable never makes it to your customer. It wouldn't make sense to build a product and then not be able to market it or sell it. Making plans to ensure an adequate handoff or transition deliverables is crucial to ensure customers are happy and projects are properly closed. In summary, you'll want to do everything you can to properly close a project because it may leave you on the hook for incomplete contracts, incomplete scope, or non-compliant practices. In the next video, we'll discuss the necessary steps included in a comprehensive closing process for clients and stakeholders.



## Case study: The impact of skipping project closure steps

In the video, we discussed the importance of the last phase of the project life cycle: closing the project. You learned that, in order to close a project, you must ensure that:

- All work is done.
- All agreed-upon project management processes have been executed.
- You have received formal recognition and agreement from key stakeholders that the project is done.

In this reading, we will discuss the impact of skipping important project closure steps. 

Sometimes project closure is improperly conducted or never happens at all. This can have a major impact on your organization’s overall profitability and success. Skipping the closure phase can compromise a project that had otherwise been running smoothly. No matter how successful the project may look in its final stages, your job as a project manager is not complete until all steps of the closure phase have been completed.

**Case study: Tilly’s Toys**

In order to better understand what can happen when a project is not properly closed out, let’s examine a possible scenario: Tilly’s Toys, a small children’s toy manufacturer, developed a new interactive piggy bank that speaks and plays songs to help children learn number recognition, counting, and adding. Below are several oversights that occurred as a result of not properly closing out the project.

**Oversight #1: Not all of the work was completed.**

**What happened**: When Tilly’s Toys received the final toy box from the packager, they realized that it did not include the safety disclaimer that the toy includes small parts and should not be used by children under the age of three. The design of this disclaimer had been included in the original Statement of Work but was never completed. 

**Impact on the organization**: When the missing disclaimer was discovered, Tilly’s Toys was not able to use any of the boxes that had been created. They incurred significant costs to have the packager create all new boxes including the disclaimer. Having to recreate the boxes also meant that they were not able to meet their original launch date, which would have had the toys in stores before the holiday season. This oversight cost the organization additional revenue and extended the project timeline and resources.

**Oversight #2: The organization did not complete an important agreed upon project management process.** 

**What happened**: Tilly’s Toys customer, a regional chain of toy stores, required that all contractors working on the project sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). The NDA stated that the contractors would not disclose any information about the toy until its launch date. One of the educational experts contracted to review the toy was never given this NDA. Not having received—or signed—this important form, the contractor posted about the new toy on social media months before the toy’s launch date.

**Impact on the organization**: Sharing information with the public before the toy was launched was a breach of contract between Tilly’s Toys and their customer. This breach put Tilly’s Toys at significant legal risk.

**Oversight #3: Stakeholders and the project manager did not provide formal recognition and agreement that the project was done.**

**What happened**: Ames, the project manager, communicated with the customer throughout the toy’s development about their objectives for the toy. After the previous oversights were rectified and Ames assumed his team was done with the project, he released the team to work on other projects. Shortly after, the customer sent a list of additional changes they wanted to see in the toy’s design.

**Impact on the organization**: Ames had to tell the customer that it was too late to implement their design requests. The customer was unhappy and told Ames that they may consider using a different toy manufacturer in the future.

**Avoiding the impact of project closure oversights**

 Oversights or skipping steps in the closing phase of a project can:

- Impact the product’s or service’s scheduled launch dates.
- Put your organization at legal risk.
- Result in significant financial losses to your organization.
- Undermine your team's credibility, and yours.
- Damage your relationship with the customer or client.

All of the steps of the project life cycle—initiating the project, making a plan, executing and completing tasks, and closing the project—are essential for a successful outcome. Unfortunately, closing the project is a phase that too often gets skipped, which can negatively impact both the project manager and their organization. To avoid these issues, make sure to plan for this phase just as you would any of the other project life cycle phases.



# The steps of the closing process 15min 

## The closing process for clients and stakeholders

In the last video, we talked about why the closing process is important in general. We'll get more specific in this video as we discuss why closing is important for clients and stakeholders. A formal closing process is important not only because improper closing may leave you on the hook for incomplete contracts or incomplete scope, but also because you want stakeholders to feel like their needs were met. As we mentioned earlier, a project team's relationship with customers, users, vendors, and so on can be impacted by loose ends. If relationships are impacted negatively, your team's credibility may be impacted. Typically, stakeholders set the goals and scope of the project alongside the project manager, so a good project manager will always want to make sure those stakeholders are satisfied with the quality of deliverables and the end product too. So how can you make sure that clients and key stakeholders are happy with the project closing? First, you'll want to decide if your project warrants a small closing process at the end of each milestone or a formal and more comprehensive closing phase near the very end. You may even decide to do both the small closing process at the end of each milestone and a more formal closing phase at the very end. You'll determine this by asking yourself if a particular milestone is final, meaning the milestone will not need to be readdressed at a later time in the project. If so, having a short, formal closeout will ensure that everyone is clear on the outcomes of that particular milestone. For example, let's put this in the context of the Project Plant Pals website launch. Launching the website is an official milestone, so having a formal close out to the website launch might make sense. Yes, there will still be ongoing updates and maintenance to the site, but it won't be launched again. The launch is a one-time event. You need to make sure you're handing over deliverables, putting together the proper documentation, and alerting all stakeholders that you've reached that milestone and that that portion of the project is now closed. If you decide to conduct closing processes after each phase or milestone, here is what that will look like for your team. First, you'll ensure that the project has satisfied the strategic goals that it was intended to meet. To begin, you'll want to refer to prior documentation such as your statement of work, request for proposal, risk register, and RACI chart. You recall that these documents were discussed in previous sections, so feel free to revisit those as a refresher. While doing so, ask yourself, was all of the required work in the elapsed phase done? Were all identified issues addressed? Did every team member complete their assigned tasks? Then you'll put together closing documentation such as creating closeout reports, which we'll cover in depth later. You'll build and review that documentation with team members to make sure that every aspect of the project has been discussed. You'll also review notes from any retrospectives you and your team participated in. This way, your team members will get a chance to speak about the aspects they liked or didn't like, and they'll leave with a sense of closure. Next, you'll conduct administrative closure of the procurement process. Close any contracts necessary, deliver the payments to vendors, and retrieve all final deliverables from contracted workers. This is really important so that external stakeholders and contracted workers can understand that the phase or the project is officially over. Then you'll want to formally recognize the completion of the phase, if necessary. Make sure all stakeholders are aware that a phase or project is ending. This may be as simple as sending out an email notifying them that you've achieved this milestone or may warrant a larger meeting. Finally, you'll complete any necessary follow-up work. This includes things like gathering final feedback and conducting closing surveys. This way, you'll proactively help stakeholders with future issues by following up and offering support. If ,instead of closing after certain phases or milestones, you've decided to close at the very end of your project, your process may be a little bit different. Here is what that might look like. First, provide the necessary training tools, documentation, and capabilities to use your product. This includes things like manuals and how-to guides, which gives your customers and users an understanding of how to use your product or service after the project is closed. Next, ensure that the project has satisfied its goals and desired outcomes. Review the project to make sure that all tasks and deliverables were completed and nothing is missing. Did you accomplish what you set out to do? Is the full scope of work completed? You'll also want to document acceptance from all stakeholders like clients and sponsors. Ensuring that you have written proof that stakeholders are happy with the deliverables and outcomes is very important. This could be in retrospectives, a project completion document, or any other formal signoff. Then review all contracts and documentation with your project team. This includes things like your SOW, RFP, RACI chart, risk register, and the procurement documents that we discussed earlier. Including your whole team in this review process will help you make sure that nothing is missed. Always document your lessons learned by conducting a formal retrospective. Include your team, any other teams involved, your stakeholders, and outside vendors in this meeting. We'll go over this in more detail in the next video. Finally, you can disband and thank the project team. The next important step in closing a project for the stakeholders is impact reporting. Impact reporting is a presentation that's given at the end of a project for key stakeholders, which typically includes the stakeholders you had in the initial kick-off meeting. The purpose of impact reporting is to demonstrate how the project went and discuss the impact of your product or service. It's important for the project manager because you'll be able to demonstrate the success of your project on your terms and present the work you did to add value to the business. In this presentation, you'll cover how the project landed in terms of time, scope, and budget. You'll state when the new service or product launch and discuss any available feedback from users, and you'll explain how the desired outcomes were achieved. Now you know more about how stakeholders and customers can get a clear understanding that your project is closed. We've discussed why that's necessary and how your reputation and credibility can be affected if you don't do extensive work to close the project completely. In the next video, we'll discuss how your team can be impacted by closing a project properly and improperly. I'll meet you there.



## Demonstrating project impact to stakeholders

Previously, you learned why completing the closing phase of the project life cycle is important. As we discussed, a formal closing process is essential because improper closing may leave you at risk for incomplete contracts and scope. It is also important to make sure that all stakeholders feel like their needs are met and to review areas for improvements in the future.

In this reading, we will further discuss how to demonstrate the impact of your project to your stakeholders through **impact reporting**. Impact reporting is a presentation or formal report prepared for key stakeholders at the end of a project. 

**Highlight key performance areas**

The purpose of your impact report is to show your key stakeholders the impact your project had on the organization. Goals, objectives, budget, schedules, and key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be determined at the beginning of your project. Your impact report should demonstrate how well you did against those early targets. In your report, you should also answer the question: What was the problem we were trying to solve, and how did we solve it? This will help you showcase the value your project outcome brought to the business.

Highlight these key performance areas to demonstrate to your stakeholders how you achieved successful results and outcomes:

- First, describe the goals and objectives you set for the project and what you hoped to have achieved by the end. 
- Then, describe how you met those objectives against your KPIs. A KPI is a measurable value that demonstrates how effective a company is at achieving their objectives. In your impact report, review how you defined the success of your project at the beginning, and highlight the outcomes you achieved that demonstrate this success.
- Finally, showcase your schedule and budget performance by outlining your cost savings and efficiencies. Demonstrate that you met the deadlines set in your project scope and that your project was completed within budget.

**Use metrics to showcase your results**

Use facts and statistics to highlight the results you achieved related to the performance areas described in the section above. Examples of common metrics you might include to demonstrate a positive impact could include: 

- Improvement in schedule performance
- Revenue growth
- Positive return on investment (ROI)
- Increased external user counts
- Increased percentage of internal users 
- Cost vs. margins
- High percentage of customer satisfaction 
- Reduction in overhead
- Reduction in technical issues
- Time saved

Metrics and data points are one of the best ways to present impact. Throughout your project, collect data and track progress in each of the areas you want to measure. If you can complement your metrics with the appropriate visuals and tie them back to the project’s larger goals, you can quickly demonstrate your project’s success and value.

**Prepare an effective impact report presentation**

An effective presentation can help your stakeholders understand your project’s impact. In order to successfully convey all of the information you have prepared: 

- **Be concise**.  While you should share metrics that illustrate how you achieved your project goals, you do not need to include extraneous details. For clarity, organize information by using bullet points instead of paragraphs. 
- **Understand your audience**.  Make sure that your report does not use too much technical language or jargon to help your stakeholders understand it.
- **Use visuals.**  Use a digital presentation application, such as Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, or Canva to present your impact report. Add diagrams, such as charts and graphs, to illustrate your results. Use images to add visual interest. Add icons to draw attention to information and help your stakeholders quickly understand information.
- **Describe your learnings.**  Discuss lessons you learned during the course of the project and any areas you have identified for improvement.

- **Keep your stakeholders engaged**.  Grab and keep your stakeholders’ attention by varying the way that you present your data:

1. **Show**: Play videos of demos, testimonials, or case studies.
2. **Storytell**: Tell a story or anecdote related to the data in the report. 
3. **Engage**: Ask for audience participation through questions, surveys, or quizzes.

**Key takeaways**

As a project manager, impact reporting is a great opportunity to demonstrate the impact of your project and the value you bring to your organization. By highlighting key performance areas, using metrics to showcase results, and preparing an effective presentation, you can impress your stakeholders and convince them of your project’s success.



## The closing process for the team

Hi again. In the last video, we focused on how to close out a project for your customer and stakeholders. In this video, we'll discuss the best practices for closing a project with your team. You'll also learn to use a retrospective to close your project and celebrate your team's accomplishments. I've talked to you about retrospectives quite a bit throughout this program, and that's because there really is no better tool for reflection and improvement. Retrospectives are such an important aspect of the project, and it's important to really emphasize that to you. Throughout the course, I'm referring to the formal practice, but a lot of us conduct informal retrospectives daily without even knowing it. Whether we're talking about our day with our friends or family or thinking about how we can improve past interactions, we are constantly reflecting and working toward progress. Let's revisit formal retrospectives for a moment to explore how they tie into the formal project closing process. You might remember that a retrospective is a meeting aimed to discuss successes, failures, and possible improvements on the project. They can occur after a major milestone completion and at the end of a project. In order to understand the importance of closing a project, let's discuss the three main retrospective benefits for your team. Retrospectives encourage team-building because they allow team members to understand differing perspectives. Retrospectives facilitate improved collaboration on future projects, and they promote positive changes in future procedures and processes. So it's no surprise that a retrospective is a critical part of closing a project. Whether your team has chosen to close the project after each phase or comprehensively at the end, you'll conduct retrospectives as a part of that process. There may be temptation within your project team to resist reflecting before forging ahead into the next phase, but you can't grow and improve if you don't spend time reflecting. Reflecting is a great way to learn which practices you should keep doing and which ones you can improve upon. As a project manager, you want to build a culture within your team and company to aim for constant improvements. This means that you'll need to solicit feedback that will help you to do better in your next project. This feedback might touch on any aspect of the project, from planning, scheduling, execution, communication, or team dynamics. You might receive feedback about processes you led, and that's okay. Working through feedback is crucial to your growth as a project manager. It's important to create a safe space for that feedback so that folks can really share what they're thinking and the team can grow together. This is a key piece to help improve collaborations on future projects. Part of encouraging continuous growth is to recognize and celebrate a job well done. The way you celebrate will change depending on where you're at in the project and what feels most appropriate to your team. Taking a moment to reward yourself with a token of appreciation turns the celebration into a team-building exercise. Being appreciative ensures that the work you're doing feels uplifting and rewarding, rather than monotonous and tiring. It also fuels positive change. So when closing a project, don't forget the fun elements. Makes sure to play a game, eat some cake, and celebrate some quality time together, because you've earned it. Let's review. Retrospectives encourage team-building because they allow team members to understand differing perspectives. They facilitate improved collaboration on future projects, and they promote positive changes in future procedures and processes. Now that you know how to wrap things up for your team, let's discuss how to wrap everything up for the project manager.



## Sarah: Why I love retrospectives

[MUSIC] Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm a program manager, on the Engineering Education team at Google. As a program manager, I manage cross functional teams on designing, launching and growing Computer Science Education Programs at Google. So right now my primary remit and my scope is essentially working with organizations in New York City to try to provide more tech education experiences and growth opportunities to youth in the area. During one of our biggest tech education moments of the year, one of the programs that I work on relies on a third party's platform to be able to run our activities and content. And during a moment where 1000s of students and teachers were getting ready to code online, the platform completely broke. And so you can imagine that the number of emails and bugs and requests that were coming into our team were plentiful. Don't panic. Communicate openly and quickly on the latter side of the issue. Once you've already, kind of, fixed the problem focus on a retrospective and a clear post-mortem that's going to help your team and then future teams be able to prevent and mitigate something like that from happening in the future. I love retrospectives. I do them all the time at Google just because they're a great way to be able to coalesce your entire team to look at the great impact that you've had. But then also reflect on some of the things that you've learned and could potentially do better for the future. And particularly at Google. What I love about retrospectives is that we have in engineering, and then across a lot of other operational roles, including project management, a culture of blamelessness, right? If something goes wrong and something breaks, instead of pointing at your engineering team to say you weren't prepared, or to point at your comms team and say there was an error, the whole team should be taking responsibility. And the whole team can actually look at that as an opportunity to improve and learn for future iterations of what you're working on. I've learned everything from big lessons around the way that you should be building more flexibility into your timeline, to very, very small tactical changes that you're going to need to make in order to be running your project more effectively. And so I think it's critical to be capturing not only these very big strategic level changes that you might want to make. But some of these small tactical things you might be able to tweak to improve efficiency going forward. Sometimes when you have assumptions or anticipations about the direction that somethings going to go and then they completely shift the other direction or they show something completely different than what you expected. [SOUND]



## The closing process for the project manager

Welcome back. Let's discuss what the project closure process means for you, the project manager. For a project manager, it's important to close the project properly for a number of reasons. Closing provides an opportunity to reflect on how you and your team performed, ensure every task is completed, and prevent confusion around the project in the future. I'll detail the importance of these closing practices, as well as the necessary documentation to successfully close a project. One of the most important aspects of thoroughly closing a project is the project closeout report. A project closeout report is a document created by project managers for project managers. A project closeout report serves three major purposes. First, it's a blueprint to document what the team did, how they did it, and what they delivered. Second, it provides an evaluation of the quality of work. And third, it evaluates the project's performance with respect to budget and schedule. Similar to the retrospective, the project closeout report can be used to determine best practices when it comes to future projects. Think of it as a transfer of knowledge from you to future project managers. For instance, once a project closes, there's a chance a similar project or a continuation of that project will come up within the organization, and maybe a different project manager is assigned to this new project while you go on to other things. If you create an in-depth closeout report, it will help the newly-assigned project manager immensely to know what happened previously on a similar project. Your closeout report could include things that worked out well and things that didn't work out so well. Creating a closeout report will also reduce the time you spend answering questions as the new project manager gets up to speed. It's safe to assume that the people reading your report in the future will be unfamiliar with the project, so be as detailed as possible. That way the new project team will be able to form an understanding of the purpose, execution, and outcome of the project based on your report alone.

In your project closeout report, you'll want to include the following things: An executive summary: this means a description of the process and what the purpose of the project was. This should be short and concise; a few sentences to a paragraph, maximum. If an executive did not have time to read the entire document and only had time to read this executive summary, would they be able to understand the project highlights? A list of key accomplishments: think of this as a way to highlight the team's accomplishments, as well as the overall impact of the project. Include any lessons learned, like: what went well, and why? What went wrong, and why? What were the major effects of key problem areas, such as scope creep and schedule slip? Any open items: this could be things you didn't quite get to or ideas for changes you'd make if you'd had the time. Your next steps: things like, are there expected follow up projects, and is there any ongoing maintenance required?
从 :3:9 开始播放视频并学习脚本3:09
You also want to include important information about the schedule and important deadlines, like: what were your milestones, and how did you choose them? How long did the project take? Did the project stay on track? And any information about major setbacks. Be sure to list resources and team members. Explain who is involved and what their roles were. This is also a key way to acknowledge people who contributed to the project's completion. And finally, include a resources and project archive section. This will include links to things like your original project plan, any documented stakeholder communication and feedback (like meeting notes), and documentation used to track, monitor, and report, and any technical information related to the project deliverables like user guides and manuals. Hopefully by now, you understand how project closeout reports are beneficial to not only the organization, but the project manager as well. Project closeout reports promote visibility among team members and create more efficient future projects. All right, we've covered a lot of information. Great job for sticking with it! In the next video, we'll revisit the concepts you've learned as we recap the module.
