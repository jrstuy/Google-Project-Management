You may start to notice how the project data impacts the team's daily activities and the overall progress and the success of the project.

> 您可能开始注意到项目数据是如何影响团队的日常活动以及项目的整体进展和成功的。

This is done by using various types of metrics.

> 这是通过使用各种类型的指标来完成的。

A metric is a quantifiable-可以计量的,可量化的 measurement-测量,计量 that is used to track and assess a business objective.

> 衡量标准是一种可量化的度量，用于跟踪和评估业务目标。

Metrics are based on selected goals.

> 度量标准基于选定的目标。

Productivity metrics allow you to track the effectiveness-有效性 and efficiency-效率,效能 of your project and include metrics like milestones, tasks, projections-估算,预测, and duration-持续时间.

> 生产力指标允许您跟踪项目的有效性和效率，并包括里程碑、任务、预测和持续时间等指标。

Let's break down each metric.

> 让我们分解每个指标。

As you may recall from an earlier course, a milestone is an important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.

> 正如您在前面的课程中所记得的，里程碑是项目进度表中的一个重要点，它指示进度，通常表示项目的可交付成果或阶段的完成。

And a project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time.

> 项目任务是需要在规定的时间内完成的活动。

A projection-体现,估算,预测 is how you predict-预言,预计 an outcome based on the information you have now.

> 预测是你如何根据你现在掌握的信息预测结果。

For example, you can predict-预言,预计 that with the resources you have at the start of the project, the project will be completed in six months.

> 例如，你可以预测，根据项目开始时的资源，项目将在六个月内完成。

The duration of a project is the total time it takes to complete a project from start to finish.

> 项目的持续时间是指从开始到结束完成一个项目所需要的总时间。

Duration can also be used for milestones and determining if you'll meet project deadlines.

> 持续时间也可以用于里程碑，并确定您是否能够满足项目截止日期。

This data is broken down into hours, days, weeks, months, and sometimes years.

> 这些数据被分解成小时、天、周、月，有时甚至是年。

So to recap, productivity metrics include milestones, tasks, projections, and duration.

> 总结一下，生产力指标包括里程碑、任务、预测/估算和持续时间。

---

Now let's discuss quality metrics.

> 现在让我们讨论质量度量。

Quality metrics relates to achieving acceptable outcomes and can include metrics such as the number of changes, issues, and cost variance-分歧,不一致, which all affect quality.

> 质量度量标准与实现可接受的结果相关，并且可以包括诸如变更、问题和成本差异的数量等度量标准，这些都影响质量。

Let's discuss each metric.

> 我们来讨论一下每个指标。

The number of changes during the project or project scope helps to monitor risks.

> 项目或项目范围内的变更数量有助于监控风险。

Changes show any inconsistencies from the initial requirements of the project.

> 变更显示了与项目初始需求的任何不一致。

A series of compounding-合成,混合 small changes may indicate a bigger issue and provide early warning signs-信号 of these issues.

> 一系列复杂的小变化可能表明一个更大的问题，并提供这些问题的早期预警信号。

Using a change log to keep a record of these changes is a useful tool for communicating with stakeholders about why something is taking a long time or costs more than expected.

> 使用变更日志来保存这些变更的记录是与涉众沟通的有用工具，可以了解为什么某些事情花费的时间较长或成本高于预期。

A change log is a record of all of the notable-显要的,值得注意的 changes on a project.

> 变更日志是项目中所有重要变更的记录。

---

An issue is a known and real problem that may affect the ability to complete a task.

> 问题是一个已知的、真实的问题，它可能会影响完成任务的能力。

For example, an issue might be the delay-推迟,延期 of legal approval for an advertisement-广告 you were hoping to launch or the missing number of confirmed seats-座位 to secure-确保,保证 a venue-发生地点,场所 for a business conference-研讨会.

> 例如，问题可能是您希望发布的广告的法律批准延迟，或者缺少确定的座位数量以确保商务会议的场地。

Another quality metric is cost variance-差额,分歧,不一致.

> 另一个质量度量是成本差异。

It illustrates the difference between the actual cost and the budget cost.

> 它说明了实际成本和预算成本之间的差异。

Simply put, cost variance compares what you plan to spend versus what you actually spent.

> 简单地说，成本差异比较的是你计划的花费和你实际的花费。

Let's put it in an example.

If you budgeted to only host 250 attendees-出席者 at an upcoming business conference but 275 people showed up and the venue-发生地点,场所 charges-费用 you for those additional guests-客人, the actual costs will be higher than your initial budget or estimate.

> 如果在即将举行的商务会议上，你的预算是只接待250名与会者，但有275人出席，而且会场向你收取了额外客人的费用，那么实际成本将高于你最初的预算或估计。

So to recap, quality metrics can include things like number of changes, issues, and cost variance.

> 因此概括一下，质量度量可以包括诸如变更数量、问题和成本差异之类的内容。

While these data points are commonly tracked by project managers, there are dozens more that you can **leverage-影响力,手段 to**-利用 inform decisions in your project.

> 虽然这些数据点通常由项目经理跟踪，但您可以利用更多的数据点来为项目中的决策提供信息。

The great news is that there's a lot of sophisticated-复杂的 software and tools dedicated-致力于,献身于 to project management and data analysis, so you'll have help keeping track of all of these different types of data in one centralized location.

> 好消息是，有很多复杂的软件和工具专门用于项目管理和数据分析，所以你可以在一个集中的位置跟踪所有这些不同类型的数据。

Project management tools like Workfront and JIRA track activity and provide readable results so you can measure the overall health of your project.

> 像Workfront和JIRA这样的项目管理工具可以跟踪活动并提供可读的结果，这样您就可以衡量项目的整体健康状况。

Data analysis tools like Tableau are useful for data visualization.

> 像Tableau这样的数据分析工具对于数据可视化非常有用。

---

Now you know a bit more about how to identify common types of data.

> 现在您了解了更多关于如何识别常见数据类型的信息。

You can also ID common project management software and tools that can help you manage and analyze data.

> 您还可以识别可以帮助您管理和分析数据的常见项目管理软件和工具。

In the next lesson, we'll cover how data helps you to make informed decisions.

> 在下一课中，我们将介绍数据如何帮助您做出明智的决策。

Meet you there.

**Data** is information.

It’s the numbers and feedback available to you about different aspects of your project.

> 它是关于项目不同方面的数字和反馈。

**Metrics** are how you measure your data.

> **指标**是你衡量数据的方式。

They define the important or specific information (data) you need to know about your project, such as productivity, quality, or engagement.

> 它们定义了您需要了解的关于项目的重要或特定信息(数据)，例如生产力、质量或参与度。

Once you determine your project's metrics, you analyze the data according to those metrics to find patterns and answer questions about your project.

> 一旦确定了项目的度量标准，就可以根据这些度量标准分析数据，以找到模式并回答有关项目的问题。

This process is called **analytics**: using data to answer questions, discover relationships, and predict-预测,预言 unknown outcomes. 

> 这个过程被称为分析：使用数据来回答问题，发现关系，预测未知的结果。

When analyzing data, ask: What do the metrics mean to you?

Predicting the future may be impossible-不可能的, but building a better understanding of it and refining your method for making projections is achievable and valuable.

> 预测未来可能是不可能的，但更好地理解它并改进你的预测方法是可以实现的，也是有价值的。



**Quality metrics**

> 质量指标

![A clipboard with a check mark ](img/7.png)

Quality metrics relate to achieving acceptable outcomes and can include metrics such as number of changes, issues, and cost variance, all of which affect quality.

> 质量度量标准与实现可接受的结果相关，并且可以包括诸如变更数量、问题和成本差异等度量标准，所有这些都影响质量。

**Changes** refer to differences in any aspect of the project from what was originally planned or required.

> **变更**是指项目在任何方面与最初计划或要求的差异。

**Issues** are problems that may affect task completion—and often result in a change.

> **问题**是可能影响任务完成的问题，通常会导致变更。

Track the number of changes and issues to identify patterns, refine processes, and share information about the project with stakeholders.

> 跟踪变更和问题的数量，以确定模式，改进过程，并与涉众共享项目信息。

**Cost** or **budget variance** is the difference between the actual amount of money spent on a project and the amount that was budgeted for the project.

Over time, this data can help you understand how well you're estimating budgets for your projects.

> 随着时间的推移，这些数据可以帮助您了解您对项目预算的估计情况。

A low variance means you've estimated your project budget accurately.

> 低方差意味着您已经准确地估算了项目预算。

A high variance means you should reevaluate your estimation process.

> 高方差意味着您应该重新评估您的估计过程。

You could be under- or over-estimating costs for your budget, or you may not be tracking expenses-开销 effectively.

> 你可能低估或高估了你的预算成本，或者你可能没有有效地跟踪开支。



**Happiness and satisfaction**

> 幸福和满足

![Two people smiling and giving a high-five](img/8.png)

Project managers at Google use a sub-set of metrics called **happiness metrics** that also relate to quality**.**

> 谷歌的项目经理使用一种称为“幸福指标”的指标子集，它也与质量有关

These are metrics that relate to different aspects of the user's overall satisfaction with a product or service, like **visual appeal-吸引力**, how likely they are to **recommend**, and **ease-容易,舒适 of use**. 

> 这些指标与用户对产品或服务的整体满意度的不同方面有关，如**视觉吸引力**，**推荐**的可能性**和**易用性**。

Happiness metrics can generally-通常 be captured with a well-designed survey or by tracking revenue-收入,收益 generated, customer retention, or product returns. 

> 幸福指标通常可以通过精心设计的调查或跟踪产生的收入、客户留存率或产品退货来获得。

**Customer satisfaction scores** reflect user **attitudes-态度,看法**, **satisfaction**, or perceived **ease of use.**

> **用户满意度得分**反映用户**态度**、**满意度**或感知**易用性**

These scores measure how well the project delivered what it set out to do and how well it satisfies customer and stakeholder needs.

> 这些分数衡量项目交付的效果，以及满足客户和涉众需求的效果。

Customer satisfaction scores generally represent a combined-结合 metric—the sum of several different happiness metrics.

> 客户满意度得分通常代表一个综合指标——几个不同的幸福指标的总和。

For example, on a satisfaction survey, a customer might separately rate a product's appearance-外表,外观 as 6/10, ease of use as 7/10, and likeness-相似 to recommend or use again as 8/10.

> 例如，在满意度调查中，客户可能分别将产品的外观评为6/10，易用性为7/10，推荐或再次使用的可能性为8/10。

The overall customer satisfaction score would then be 7/10. 

> 那么整体客户满意度得分将是7/10。

You will need to determine what scores are acceptable for your project by discussing with stakeholders what the most important aspects of the project are. 

> 您需要通过与涉众讨论项目中最重要的方面来确定您的项目可以接受的分数。

**Adoption-采用,采纳 and engagement**

> 采用和参与

![A mobile device held by the user who is engaging with a website](img/9.png)

Another set of metrics related to quality are adoption and engagement.

> 另一组与质量相关的指标是采用率和参与度。

**Adoption** refers to whether or not a product, service or process is accepted and used.

> **采用**是指产品、服务或过程是否被接受和使用。

**Engagement** refers to the degree-程度 to which it is used—the frequency-频繁,频率 of use, amount of time spent using it, and the range of use. 

> **参与度**指的是使用的程度——使用的频率、使用的时间和使用的范围。

It might help to think of these in terms of throwing a party: your adoption metrics would reveal-表明,证明 to you whether or not people accepted the invitation-邀请 and showed up.

> 用举办派对的方式来考虑这些可能会有所帮助:你的采纳指标将向你显示人们是否接受邀请并出席。

The engagement metrics would tell you how active they were at the party—whether they participated in activities or interacted-相互作用,相互影响 with other attendees, if they invited their friends to come with them, and how long they stayed. 

> 参与度指标会告诉你他们在聚会上有多活跃——他们是否参与活动或与其他参与者互动，他们是否邀请朋友一起来，以及他们待了多长时间。

**Adoption metrics** for a product or service release, like an app, software program, delivery service, or gym-健身房 membership, would be similar to the party example.

> 产品或服务发布(如应用程序、软件程序、交付服务或健身房会员资格)的采用指标将类似于聚会的例子。

However, they can be a bit more complex-复杂 if you need to track metrics for more than one thing, like whether users make additional purchases or sign up for premium-高品质的 features. 

> 然而，如果你需要追踪不止一件事的参数，比如用户是否进行额外购买或注册高级功能，情况就会变得复杂一些。

Each project will need to define its own set of successful adoption metrics, such as:

> 每个项目都需要定义自己的一套成功采用的度量标准，例如:

- Conversion-转换,转换 rates

- Time to value (TTV)

	> 时间价值比(TTV)

- Onboarding-入职 completion rates

	> 入职完成率

- Frequency of purchases

	> 采购频率

- Providing feedback (rating the product or service)

	> 提供反馈(评价产品或服务)

- Completing a profile

	> 完成曲线图

**Engagement metrics** tell you to what degree a product, service, or process is being used.

> 用户粘性指标告诉你产品、服务或流程的使用程度。

They reveal-揭示,透露 the frequency and type of customer interaction and participation over time.

> 随着时间的推移，它们揭示了客户互动和参与的频率和类型。

Engagement metrics might include the daily usage-使用 rate of a design feature or tracking orders and customer interactions. 

> 用户粘性指标可能包括设计功能的每日使用率或跟踪订单和客户交互。

As a project manager, you're not only concerned-关心 with the end user's level of engagement.

> 作为项目经理，您不仅要关心最终用户的参与程度。

It's just as important to monitor stakeholder and team member engagement as well.

> 监控涉众和团队成员的参与也同样重要。

Measuring stakeholder participation by tracking the **frequency of communication**, **responses** to emails or updates, **attendance-出席,出勤** at meetings, or **level of input** can give you a sense of whether or not stakeholders are finding value in the project.

> 通过跟踪沟通的频率、对电子邮件或更新的回应、出席会议的人数或投入的水平来衡量干系人的参与，可以让您了解干系人是否在项目中发现了价值。

A lack of meaningful engagement could put your project at risk.

> 缺乏有意义的参与可能会使你的项目处于危险之中。

Stakeholders may not be aware of changes or the overall progress of the project, and therefore-因此,所以 the final outcome of the project may not meet their expectations.

> 干系人可能不知道项目的变化或整体进展，因此项目的最终结果可能不符合他们的期望。

Measuring team member engagement is vital to the success of your project because the more engaged they are, the more productive they are, and the more likely they are to produce high-quality results. 

> 衡量团队成员的参与度对于项目的成功是至关重要的，因为他们的参与度越高，他们的生产力就越高，他们就越有可能产生高质量的结果。

Ideally-理想地,观念上地, you want your adoption and engagement metrics to increase or to at least meet the goal metrics that were established with stakeholders earlier in the project.

> 理想情况下，您希望您的采用和参与度量增加，或者至少满足项目早期与涉众建立的目标度量。

If there is no increase, or the metrics drop-下降, then your rates are low and therefore not as successful.

> 如果没有增加，或者参数下降，那么你的比率就很低，因此不成功。

Check out the resources below for a more in-depth understanding of how and why to measure adoption and engagement.

>请查看下面的参考资料，以更深入地了解如何以及为什么度量采用率和参与度。

**Key takeaway**

Data, metrics and analytics are all important to the success of your project.

> 数据、参数和分析对于项目的成功都很重要。

You'll need to have some familiarity with how to collect and measure data, and how to use the data to tell you about different aspects of your project.

> 您需要熟悉如何收集和测量数据，以及如何使用数据来告诉您项目的不同方面。

Depending on the project and its unique goals, some metrics will be more important than others.

> 根据项目及其独特的目标，一些指标将比其他指标更重要。

It's your job to make sure you understand which metrics your stakeholders are most interested in and what elements impact your team's ability to deliver quality results on time and within budget.

> 你的工作是确保你了解你的涉众最感兴趣的指标，以及哪些因素会影响你的团队按时在预算范围内交付高质量结果的能力。

# Prioritizing and analyzing data

> 对数据进行优先排序和分析

## Discerning-辨别,识出 important data

> 辨别重要数据

Welcome back.Let's get back to discussing all things data.

欢迎回来。让我们继续讨论有关数据的一切。

Earlier, we learned about what data is, its value to the project manager, and the different types of data a project manager works with.

> 早些时候，我们了解了数据的定义，以及它对项目经理的价值，以及项目经理在工作中会处理不同类型的数据。

In this lesson, we'll discuss how to identify the most important data for your project, how to prioritize the data you collect, and how to effectively gather-收集,采集 priorities from your stakeholders so that you're meeting your goals.

> 在这节课中，我们将讨论如何确定项目中最重要的数据，如何对你收集的数据进行优先排序，以及如何有效地从利益相关者那里获取他们的优先事项，以确保你能够实现项目的目标。

Let's get started.

> 让我们开始吧。

---

Did you know that the average temperature-温度,体温 for most humans-人们 is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit-华氏度? So if your temperature-温度,体温 reached 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, there would likely be signals that something's not quite right, like a sweaty-出汗的 forehead-前额, muscle-肌肉,力气 aches-疼痛, or even dehydration-脱水.

> 你知道吗，大多数人的平均体温是华氏98.6度吗？所以，如果你的体温达到华氏100.4度或更高，很可能会出现信号表明有些不太对劲，比如额头出汗、肌肉疼痛，甚至脱水。

Your brain-大脑 would begin to receive signals that something is off because it's the brain's job to pay attention to the signals that indicate there's a problem threatening-威胁,危及 your overall health. That's how you should think about data when it comes to managing your project.

> 你的大脑会开始接收这些信号，表明有问题正在威胁你的整体健康。这就是你在管理项目时应该思考数据的方式。

There are all kinds of information and facts that you can gather as a project manager, but it's important for you to be aware of the signals that threaten the overall success of the project.

> 作为项目经理，你可以收集各种信息和事实，但重要的是要了解威胁项目整体成功的信号。

A signal is an observable-看得见的,显著的 change, and it can help you to determine the overall health of your project and identify early signs that something isn't quite right.

> 信号是可观察到的变化，它可以帮助你确定项目的整体健康状况，并识别早期出现的问题迹象。

Being aware of the different types of data you have access to and knowing which signals to respond to are key to deciding what data is most important.

> 了解你可以访问的不同类型的数据以及知道应该如何响应的信号对于决定哪些数据最重要至关重要。

Maybe you're asking yourself, "How do I determine what data is important?" Great question.

> 也许你会问自己：“如何确定哪些数据重要？”这是一个很好的问题。

As a project manager, it's up to you to look for signals and to prioritize data to deliver positive-积极的,乐观的 results. There are a couple of ways you can begin to do this.

> 作为项目经理，需要由你来寻找信号并优先考虑数据以提供积极的结果。你可以开始有几种方法。

One way is to observe your team's productivity and output. Identify which tasks contribute most to the overall goal. This will help you determine the importance of which data points—in this case, tasks and activities—you should focus on.

> 其中一种方法是观察你的团队的生产力和产出。确定哪些任务对整体目标的贡献最大。这将帮助你确定哪些数据点的重要性，比如任务和活动，你应该关注。

Secondly, prioritize the data or metrics that are most valuable to stakeholders. For example, let's say you have an ongoing project at a manufacturing-生产,制造 company to release a portable-便携式的,轻便的 home appliance-家用电器 by the third quarter. Your stakeholder is concerned-担心,忧虑 about whether or not you'll meet the deadline. Okay, start by thinking, what data do you have about the project?

> 其次，优先考虑对利益相关者最有价值的数据或指标。例如，假设你在一个制造公司进行一个到第三季度发布便携家电的持续项目。你的利益相关者担心你是否能按期完成项目。好的，首先思考一下，关于这个项目你有哪些数据？

You know that it's the first quarter and you're already $2,000 over budget. But you also know that you're 30 days ahead of schedule according to your burndown-燃尽图 chart, which measures time against-与…相比,反对,违背 the amount of work done and the amount of work remaining-剩下的,遗留的. You may think your project is running as scheduled, but there are additional things to consider.

> 你知道现在是第一季度，你的预算已经超支了2,000美元。但你也知道，根据你的燃尽图表，即度量时间与已完成的工作量和剩余工作量的比较，你的进度比计划提前30天。你可能认为你的项目按计划进行，但还有其他要考虑的事情。

For one, the number of tasks has increased by ten percent over the last three weeks because your stakeholders want to add more features to the appliance-家用电器,装置. And now your team's productivity is slowing down because they're starting to **burn out**-精疲力竭 from the late nights and long hours required to add in those new features. Now how do you feel about meeting that third quarter deadline? Not so good, right? What do you do?

> 首先，过去三周内任务数量增加了百分之十，因为你的利益相关者希望为这个家电增加更多功能。现在，你的团队的生产力正在下降，因为他们为了添加新功能而通宵达旦工作，时间长了，他们开始感到疲倦。现在对于达到第三季度的截止日期你有什么感觉？感觉不太好，对吧？你会怎么做？

You might be tempted-引诱,诱惑 to focus on the signal that you're $2,000 over budget, but if your stakeholders communicated that they're more concerned with meeting the deadline than they were about being over budget, then you'll want to keep an eye on key signals related to time and scope rather than budget, and then **hone-磨练,训练 in**-聚焦,专注 on those signals to identify and prioritize areas to improve.

> 你可能会倾向于关注你的预算超支这个信号，但如果你的利益相关者传达他们更担心截止日期而不是预算超支，那么你将希望关注与时间和范围相关的关键信号，而不是预算，然后集中精力识别和优先处理改进的领域。

The relevant data tells you you'll be able to meet the deadline, provided that stakeholders stop requesting new product features that result in more tasks for your team to complete. You can use your productivity metrics to forecast how you'll manage an increase in scope with your team's current productivity rate and communicate this to your stakeholder.

> 相关数据告诉你，只要利益相关者不再要求添加新的产品功能，从而导致团队需要完成更多任务，你将能够按时完成截止日期。你可以使用生产率指标来预测如何在当前生产率的情况下管理范围的增加，并将这一信息传达给利益相关者。

To avoid having to reset-调整,重新设置 expectations with stakeholders again and again, you can keep your project plan up to date with the project's priorities and ensure that this information is accessible to everyone. Stakeholders can look to your project plan for a high-level overview of answers to important questions, success criteria, artifacts-文物, and the overall health of your project.

> 为了避免不断与利益相关者重新设定期望，你可以保持项目计划与项目的优先级保持一致，并确保这些信息对每个人都是可访问的。利益相关者可以查看你的项目计划，以获取关于重要问题、成功标准、文物以及项目整体状况的高级概述。

Remember, there are a lot of data points available to you. Using signals, focusing on the tasks that have the biggest impact on the project goal, and aligning to your stakeholders' priorities are a good way to help you prioritize the right tasks. Now that you identified data and prioritized it so that you're working to meet business needs, the next thing to determine is how to use the data to make better decisions. We'll cover that when we connect in the next video.

> 请记住，有很多数据点可供你使用。使用信号，关注对项目目标影响最大的任务，以及与利益相关者的优先事项保持一致，这是帮助你优先考虑正确任务的好方法。既然你已经确定了数据并为了满足业务需求进行了优先级排序，下一步要确定如何使用数据做出更好的决策。我们将在下一个视频中讨论这个问题。



## Data ethics considerations

> 

In the previous video, you learned how to use knowledge to discern data and how signals help prioritize data. This reading will cover the importance of **data ethics** and two key principles: **data privacy** and **data bias**.



**Data ethics**

As a project manager, data collection and analysis will be a key part of your projects. As you’ve learned, you’ll collect data from a variety of sources, including focus groups, interviews and questionnaires. The data you collect will usually hold **PII (personally identifiable information)**—information that could be used to directly identify, contact, or locate an individual. A lot of times, you will also need to report on the data you collect to stakeholders, customers, and your project team. Collecting, analyzing, and sharing this data in an ethical way is extremely important for maintaining the integrity of your organization, your projects, and your position.

**Data ethics** is the study and evaluation of moral challenges related to data collection and analysis. This includes generating, recording, curating, processing, sharing, and using data in order to come up with ethical solutions.

Businesses apply data ethics practices so they can:

- Comply with regulations
- Show that they are trustworthy
- Ensure fair and reasonable data usage
- Minimize biases
- Develop a positive public perception

Data ethics is rooted in several principles. In this reading, we will focus on two of these principles: **data privacy** and **data bias**.

**Data privacy**

**Data privacy** is a key part of data ethics. Data privacy deals with the proper handling of data. This includes the purpose of data collection and processing, privacy preferences, the way organizations manage personal data, and the rights of individuals. It focuses on making sure the ways we collect, process, share, archive, and delete data are all in accordance with the law.

As a project manager, it is your responsibility to protect the data you collect. You can help ensure the privacy of data collected from users, stakeholders, and others for your projects by:

- **Increasing data privacy awareness**. Make sure every member of your project team—plus the vendors, contractors, and other stakeholders from outside of your company—are made aware of your organization's data security and privacy protocols.
- **Using security tools**. Free security tools, like encrypted storage solutions and password managers, can decrease your project’s vulnerability to a data breach. In a lot of applications, like ones that are part of Google Workspace and Microsoft OneDrive, privacy settings can be adjusted to only give access to specific individuals.
- **Anonymizing data**. Data anonymization refers to one or more techniques such as blanking, hashing, or masking personal and identifying information to protect the identities of people included in the data. This helps protect individuals’ personal information by keeping them anonymous. Once the information has been anonymized, it can then be used and shared freely. Types of data that should be anonymized include names, telephone numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, photographs, and account numbers.

**Data bias**

Another important data ethics practice is making sure that the data you collect does not indicate any biases. **Data bias** is a type of error that tends to skew results in a certain direction. Maybe the questions on your survey had a particular slant to influence answers, or maybe your sample group was not fully representative of the population you want to study. Bias can also happen if a sample group lacks inclusivity. For example, if your sample does not include people with disabilities. The way you collect data can also bias a dataset. Say you give people only a short time to answer questions, this can lead to rushed responses. When people are rushed, they tend to make more mistakes, which can affect the quality of their data and create biased outcomes. As a project manager, you have to think about bias and fairness from the moment you start collecting data to the time you present your conclusions. 



**Types of biases**

There are different types of biases to keep in mind when setting up your data collection processes. Here are four of the most common types of biases that could impact your data:

- **Sampling bias** is when a sample is not representative of the population as a whole. For example, maybe your sample did not include people above the age of 65. Or maybe you excluded people from certain socioeconomic groups.
- **Observer bias** is the tendency for different people to observe things differently. For example, stakeholders from different parts of the world might view the same data differently and draw different conclusions from it. 
- **Interpretation bias** is the tendency to always interpret situations that don’t have obvious answers in a strictly positive or negative way, when, in fact there is more than one way to understand the data. Data that does not provide an obvious set of conclusions makes some people feel anxious, which can lead to interpretation bias. For example, a team member might interpret inconclusive survey results negatively, while other team members might be able to think more carefully and assess the data from different angles. 
- **Confirmation bias** is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs. For example, you might ask only specific stakeholders for feedback on parts of your project because you know they are the most likely to have the same perspective as you.

Each of these types of bias affect the way you collect and make sense of the data, so it is important to be aware of them when setting up your data collection processes. 



**Key takeaway**

According to the Project Management Institute’s [Code of Ethics & Professional Conduct](https://www.pmi.org/about/ethics/code#:~:text=Ethics is about making the,absolutely dependent on ethical choices.), “Ethics is about making the best possible decisions concerning people, resources, and the environment. Ethical choices diminish risk, advance positive results, increase trust, determine long term success, and build reputations. Leadership is absolutely dependent on ethical choices."

A key way you can show your leadership skills is by exercising sound judgment when it comes to data ethics. In order to tell a project’s data-informed story to stakeholders, project team members, and others in an ethical way, you have to make sure you think about both privacy and bias-related concerns in how you conduct, analyze, and share that data.



## Using data analysis to inform decisions

Hi again! In this video, we'll go into data analysis and how project managers use it to make informed decisions throughout a project.

>  在这个视频中，我们将深入探讨数据分析以及项目经理如何在整个项目中使用数据来做出明智的决策。

We use data every day to help us make both simple and important decisions in our lives.

> 我们每天都使用数据来帮助我们在生活中做出简单和重要的决策。

For example, imagine that you're saving money for a big purchase. Maybe you decided that the best way to reach your goal sooner is to create a budget. After spending time reviewing your budget, perhaps you find that your weekly expenses are higher than your weekly allowances and that many of your expenses are from ordering food and dining out. You realize that in order for you to reach your goal, you'll need to start spending less money on eating out and find more cost-effective ways to buy food. With this new information, you've found a way to save up for your big purchase.

> 例如，想象一下，你正在为一笔大购物储钱。也许你决定更快地实现目标的最佳方式是制定一个预算。在花时间审查预算后，也许你发现你的周支出高于周津贴，并且许多支出都用于外卖和外出就餐。你意识到为了实现目标，你需要开始花更少的钱在外出就餐，并找到更经济的购买食物的方式。有了这些新信息，你找到了一种储钱以实现大购物的方法。

Similar to how you might create an adjusted budget to reach a desired outcome, it's your role as a project manager to select appropriate data to help inform your decision-making. You can do this using a process called data analysis. Data analysis is the process of collecting and organizing information to help draw conclusions. It's used to solve problems, make informed decisions, and support goals.

> 就像你可能会制定一个调整后的预算来实现期望的结果一样，作为项目经理，你的角色是选择适当的数据来帮助指导你的决策。你可以使用一种称为数据分析的过程来实现这一点。数据分析是收集和组织信息以帮助得出结论的过程。它用于解决问题，做出明智的决策，并支持目标。

Businesses use data analysis to reveal important insights and patterns within their data that help inform actions and drive results. Gathering data is only part of the process. The other part is analyzing the data. What you learn from your analysis becomes knowledge that powers smart solutions for your project.

> 企业使用数据分析来揭示数据中的重要见解和模式，以帮助指导行动并推动结果。收集数据只是过程的一部分。另一部分是分析数据。你从分析中学到的知识将成为推动项目智能解决方案的动力。

Project managers will often apply data analysis to look for repeated behaviors and to find a solution based on data predictions.

> 项目经理通常会应用数据分析来寻找重复的行为并基于数据预测找到解决方案。

For example, let's imagine that a ride-share company has a group of data analysts working on using patterns in rider behavior to improve customer support. They noticed a high demand for drivers midweek during rush hour in one specific city. As a result, riders are having a hard time getting drivers to pick them up during peak hours. As a project manager, you've been asked to come up with a solution to help meet the increased demand for drivers. You work with your team to determine which data points would be most appropriate to review. You might decide to track peak traffic times, the number of average daily rider requests, and the number of available drivers. These data points can help inform how to solve for the high demand during rush hour.

> 例如，让我们想象一下，一家共乘公司有一组数据分析师，他们致力于利用乘客行为中的模式来改善客户支持。他们注意到，在特定城市的工作日高峰时段，对司机的需求很高。因此，乘客在高峰时段很难找到司机接送。作为项目经理，你被要求提出解决办法，以满足对司机的增加需求。你与团队合作确定了哪些数据点最适合审查。你可以决定跟踪高峰交通时间、平均每日乘客请求的数量以及可用司机的数量。这些数据点可以帮助指导如何解决高峰时段的高需求。

After analyzing the data, your team realizes that one solution could be to offer incentives to drivers to pick up riders in the city during peak times. The new incentives make drivers feel appreciated, and the increase in drivers increases customer satisfaction. And you came to this solution thanks to the insights gleaned from data analysis.

> 在分析数据后，你的团队意识到一个解决方案可能是向司机提供激励，以在高峰时段接送乘客。新的激励措施使司机感到受到赞赏，司机的增加提高了客户满意度。而且，由于从数据分析中获取的见解，你提出了这个解决方案。

In this example, you collected types of data: qualitative and quantitative. Quantitative data includes statistical and numerical facts about the number of rider requests that came in. Requests in the city increased at specific points over a period of time. The other data is qualitative data, which describes the subjective qualities or things that can't be measured with numerical data, like user feedback about the service or product.

> 在这个示例中，你收集了不同类型的数据：定量数据和定性数据。定量数据包括有关乘客请求数量的统计和数值事实。城市内的请求在一段时间内的特定时间点有所增加。另一种数据是定性数据，它描述了主观特质或无法用数值数据测量的事物，比如关于服务或产品的用户反馈。

In project management, you will use both qualitative data and quantitative data points to inform decisions, make improvements, and share insights.

> 在项目管理中，你将使用定性数据和定量数据点来指导决策，进行改进和分享见解。

Coming up, you'll learn how to tell stories using data and effective ways to present. Meet you there.

> 接下来，你将学习如何使用数据讲述故事以及有效的呈现方式。我们在那里见面。





## The six steps of data analysis

In an earlier video, you learned that **data analysis** is the process of collecting and organizing information to help draw conclusions, solve problems, make informed decisions, and support your goals. In this reading, we will go over the key parts of the data analysis process. 

There are six main steps involved in data analysis: **Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share** and **act**. Let’s break these down one by one. 



![Icon for "Ask"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/c_SlNsbqSc20pTbG6rnNXw_c7e6caffa04c4ed5be8acb9bf8ff4dbd_DA_C1M1L2R1_A.png?expiry=1698969600000&hmac=yK3bw8HuQ4HKHOLhkbjqxcvBelACf38HUMeXum0pOB4)

During the **Ask** phase, ask key questions to help frame your analysis, starting with: What is the problem? When defining the problem, look at the current state of the business and identify how it is different from the ideal state. Usually, there is an obstacle in the way or something wrong that needs to be fixed. At this stage, you want to be as specific as possible. You also want to stay focused on the problem itself, not just the symptoms. For example, imagine you are doing data analysis for a gym that is losing memberships. You could ask: Why do we keep losing members? But a better and more specific question would be: What factors are negatively impacting the member experience? That way, when you set off to do your research, you know exactly what to look for. 



![Line graph trending downwards for gym memberships declining month-over-month](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/r2pjZWd1QHaqY2VndWB2Fg_69d5bf9a61444efa872f353610ce85c6_C4M3L2R2.png?expiry=1698969600000&hmac=g1vvTtuwDcx-YC9OpYo770X8bIDKByK3UiY6hhMPymE)

Another part of the **Ask** stage is identifying your stakeholders and understanding their expectations. There can be lots of stakeholders on a project, and each of them can make decisions, influence actions, and weigh in on strategies. Each stakeholder will also have specific goals they want to meet. It is pretty common for a stakeholder to come to you with a problem that needs solving. But before you begin your analysis, you need to be clear about what they are asking of you. For example, if your manager assigns you a project related to analyzing the gym’s business risk, it would be a good idea to confirm whether they want you to analyze all types of risks that could affect the gym or just risks related to weather or seasonal trends.



![Icon for "prepare"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/zd0bH2DHTVSdGx9gx_1U6Q_00b892e65386495aaaae3ce458aed86e_DA_C1M1L2R1_B.png?expiry=1698969600000&hmac=ChoaVdC2PFKhIuemkoCaae1SXivRlIsTa9IF-6_rxA8)

After you have a clear direction, it is time to move to the **Prepare** stage. This is where you collect and store the data you will use for the upcoming analysis process. 

Let’s turn back to our gym membership example. To collect data on the member experience, you decide to send surveys to the gym’s members asking for feedback about their experience. To make sure you get specific answers, you ask them to offer feedback in three distinct categories: upkeep of the facility, customer service, and membership cost**.** You also leave room for them to write in a response. When you get the member surveys back, it is important that you have an organized system for tracking and filing them.  



![Icon for "Process"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/oz6QsMleQF--kLDJXrBfEA_df977ac33dde4c5ba8bc19fe660c1a1b_DA_C1M1L2R1_C.png?expiry=1698969600000&hmac=gdOuCwrIWWMTxkOOEv6cSrDwGhG8-hCcKWJvmFZ1Q8c)

This stage is when it is time to **Process** your data. In this step, you will “clean” your data, which means you will enter your data into a spreadsheet, or another tool of your choice, and eliminate any inconsistencies and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. While collecting data, be sure to get rid of any duplicate responses or biased data. This helps you know that any decisions made from the analysis are based on facts and that they are fair and unbiased. For example, if you noticed duplicate responses from a single gym member when sorting through the surveys, you would need to get rid of the copies to be sure your data set is accurate. 

During this stage, it is also important to check the data you prepared to make sure it is complete and correct and that there are no typos or other errors. 



![icon for "analyze"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/WCm702aQQ6Wpu9NmkKOlfg_26847d884b2342bfba42712e4f649192_DA_C1M1L2R1_D.png?expiry=1698969600000&hmac=Cx5v_4omrKR2d8LjwYxwv_MW8eti4F9NmtYGtZzn4aQ)

Now it is time to **Analyze**. In this stage, you take a close look at your data to draw conclusions, make predictions, and decide on next steps. Here, you will transform and organize the data in a way that highlights the full scope of the results so you can figure out what it all means. You can create visualizations using charts and graphs to determine if there are any trends or patterns within the data or any need for additional research. 

In our gym membership example, let’s say you notice 50% of the members wrote in an additional response on the survey citing that the equipment is outdated. The survey also showed that 75% of the responses cited “expensive membership fees.” When looking at the 50% of responses citing “outdated equipment” and 75% of responses citing “expensive membership fees” side by side on a graph, you may be able to deduce that these responses inform one another. Members feel like the experience just isn’t worth the price. You might conclude that the gym should invest in new equipment if they want to keep members and add value to the membership fee.

Once you have asked questions to figure out the problem—then prepared, processed, and analyzed the data—it is time to **Share** your findings. In this stage, you use **data visualization** to organize your data in a format that is clear and digestible for your audience. When sharing, you can offer the insights you gained during your analysis to help stakeholders make effective, data-driven decisions for solving the problem. 



![Icon for "Act"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/XW23hYKzTIitt4WCs0yIOQ_ba83e3f966994e93af0257a2f0068288_DA_C1M1L2R1_F.png?expiry=1698969600000&hmac=CiPuTwSHgBHYkMDiGmj70QiyS3cNRpLEYZT2v4WYllo)

And finally, you are ready to **Act**! In the final stage of your data analysis, the business takes all of the insights you have provided and puts them into action to solve the original business problem. 

Conducting a data analysis is an essential process for understanding a business’ needs and challenges and determining effective solutions. These six foundational steps—**ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,** and **act**—will help set you up for success! 





# Presenting and visualizing data

## Presenting data to tell a project's story

Welcome back. In this video, we'll discuss how to tell a powerful story using data.

> 欢迎回来。在这个视频中，我们将讨论如何使用数据讲述有力的故事。

We'll teach you how to gather and organize your project data to present it to others within your organization. Presenting is a powerful way to communicate your ideas and support your decisions throughout the project journey.

> 我们将教你如何收集和组织项目数据，以便向组织内的其他人进行展示。展示是在整个项目过程中传达你的想法并支持你的决策的强大方式。

Think of presenting as telling the story of your project. Storytelling is the process of turning facts into narrative to communicate something to your audience. Storytelling is how you bring data to life and is a useful way to tell stakeholders within your organization about your project. In a way, we're all storytellers using information and experiences to share ideas with others.

> 将展示看作是讲述你的项目故事。讲故事是将事实转化为叙述的过程，以向观众传达信息。讲故事是如何让数据生动起来的方式，也是向组织内的利益相关者讲述项目的有用方式。在某种程度上，我们都是使用信息和经验来与他人分享想法的讲故事者。

Stories usually have a beginning, middle, and end. To tell a great story using data, we'll go over some best practices to make sure your story is complete, accurate, and compelling.

> 故事通常有一个开头、中间和结尾。为了使用数据讲述一个出色的故事，我们将介绍一些最佳实践，以确保你的故事完整、准确和引人入胜。

In general, there are six main steps to storytelling. First, define your audience. Then, collect the data. Next, filter and analyze the data. Fourth, choose a visual representation. Then, shape the story. And finally, gather your feedback. Now let's review each one.

> 总的来说，讲故事有六个主要步骤。首先，确定你的受众。然后，收集数据。接下来，过滤和分析数据。第四，选择视觉呈现方式。然后，塑造故事。最后，收集反馈。现在让我们逐一回顾每一步。

Step 1: Define your audience. In this first step, it's important to know who you're presenting to. Are you presenting to project sponsors or executives? Or to team members? Define your audience and find out what matters most to them. Begin by asking yourself qualifying questions like: What would my audience want to know about the project? Or, what are their most urgent concerns? Which key data points influence the story and project outcome? This will set you up to know the type of story you want to tell and the type of data you should use to tell it.

> 步骤1：定义你的受众。在这第一步中，了解你要向谁进行展示非常重要。你是向项目赞助商或高管进行展示吗？还是向团队成员？明确定义你的受众并找出对他们最重要的事项。从自问一些资格问题开始，比如：我的受众想了解项目的什么信息？或者，他们最紧急的关注点是什么？哪些关键数据点影响了故事和项目的结果？这将帮助你知道你想要讲述的故事类型以及应该使用的数据类型。

For example, years ago, I was working on a project for Google Maps. Our goal was to apply a label to every business in the world: restaurants, hotels, gas stations—you name it. There are many, many, many businesses in the world, and I only had a small team of engineers to work with. For this project, we tailored our storytelling to an audience of vice presidents from Google Maps and Google Search. Both were important to consider, because we were helping users find and connect to businesses through the Google Maps app and through Google Search. I'll return to this example as I take you through the steps of storytelling.

> 例如，多年前，我曾经参与了一个Google Maps的项目。我们的目标是为世界上的每家企业都标上标签：餐馆、酒店、加油站——你名字都有。世界上有很多很多企业，而我只有一个小团队的工程师可以合作。对于这个项目，我们根据Google Maps和Google搜索的副总裁受众来定制了我们的讲故事方式。考虑到这两方面都很重要，因为我们正在帮助用户通过Google Maps应用和Google搜索找到并连接到企业。在我带你逐步讲故事的过程中，我将回到这个例子。

Next step is Step 2: Find the data that connects to the

 question you want to answer. You'll need to begin searching for data from trustworthy resources to support the point you're trying to make. Leverage the relevant project resources in documents like your project plan or work management software to download and analyze key data points. For my Google Maps project, the question we were trying to answer was: Where should we focus our attention first? So to find the right data for this question, we turned to the many businesses in our internal database and the available information about what types of businesses users were searching for.

> 下一步是第二步：找到与你要回答的问题相关的数据。你需要开始搜索来自可信资源的数据，以支持你要表达的观点。利用项目计划或工作管理软件等文档中的相关项目资源，下载并分析关键数据点。对于我的Google Maps项目，我们试图回答的问题是：我们应该首先关注哪里？因此，为了找到这个问题的合适数据，我们查阅了内部数据库中的众多企业以及关于用户搜索的企业类型的可用信息。

That brings us to Step 3: Filter and analyze the data. Now that you've collected your data, you'll need to vet it for credibility and filter the information. For my Maps project, we used search queries to determine the types of businesses that users searched for most often, which included restaurants, cafes, and hotels. There were other categories—gas stations, museums, etc.—but they collectively made up a much smaller percentage of geo-specific search traffic.

> 这将我们带到第三步：过滤和分析数据。现在你已经收集了数据，你需要对其进行核查以确保可信度并过滤信息。对于我的地图项目，我们使用搜索查询来确定用户最常搜索的企业类型，包括餐厅、咖啡馆和酒店。还有其他类别——加油站、博物馆等——但它们共同占据了地理特定搜索流量的很小比例。

Step 4: Choose a visual representation. Visualizations are a great way to help people remember the information you're presenting and are an essential piece of storytelling. You can use data in different ways to tell a story, like using dashboards, charts, infographics, and mappings, and we'll go over these examples in more detail in the next video. For my Maps project, we decided on a pie chart to help tell our story.

> 第四步：选择视觉呈现方式。可视化是帮助人们记住你呈现的信息的绝佳方式，也是讲故事的重要组成部分。你可以使用不同的方式来使用数据来讲述故事，比如使用仪表板、图表、信息图表和地图，我们将在下一个视频中更详细地讨论这些例子。对于我的地图项目，我们决定使用饼图来帮助讲述我们的故事。

Which brings me to Step 5: Shape the story. After you've analyzed your data and know how you'd like to visualize it, it's time to tie it all together into one cohesive narrative. Take some time to think about what you're hoping to achieve, the points you want to make, and the questions and concerns you want to answer. For the Maps project, we used the pie chart to show that most geo-specific search queries are covered by a relatively small number of businesses. So we built a story about that data. We wanted agreement from our VPs to work on improving the data behind this set of categories in a few major markets. It needed to illustrate that if we improved the category data, we'd succeed in improving the search results for more than 50% of geo searches.

> 这将我们带到第五步：塑造故事。在你分析了数据并知道如何将其可视化之后，是时候将所有内容汇集成一个连贯的叙述了。花些时间考虑你希望实现什么，你想提出哪些观点，以及你想回答的问题和关切。对于地图项目，我们使用饼图来展示大多数地理特定搜索查询由相对较少的企业涵盖。因此，我们建立了关于这些数据的故事。我们希望我们的副总裁同意致力于改善几个主要市场中这一类别背后的数据。它需要说明，如果我们改进了类别数据，我们将成功改进超过50%的地理搜索的搜索结果。

Lastly is Step 6: Gather your feedback. Similar to how you may ask a friend to practice with you before an interview, you want to be sure that before you present, you do a trial run. Try getting feedback from someone who's not connected to the project. Find out if it was interesting. Did it make sense? What questions did they have? Their feedback can help you identify areas of your story that were unclear or unmemorable and give you a final chance to make adjustments.

> 最后是第六步：收集反馈。与你在面试前可能会请朋友练习一样，你需要确保在你展示之前进行试运行。尝试从与项目无关的人那里获得反馈。看看它是否有趣。是否讲得通？他们有什么问题？他们的反馈可以帮助你确定你的故事中不清楚或不易记忆的部分，并给你最后一个调整的机会。

To recap, you want to define your audience, collect the data, filter and analyze the data, choose a visual representation, shape the story, and finally, gather your feedback. The key to effective storytelling is to be organized, intentional, and prepared.

> 总结一下，你需要明确定义你的受众，收集数据，过滤和分析数据，选择视觉呈现方式，塑造故事，最后，收集反馈。有效讲故事的关键是组织有序，有意识，并做好准备。

Coming up, we'll talk more about Step 4: effective visualization. See you there.

> 接下来，我们将更多地讨论第四步：有效的可视化。我们下次见。



## Data visualization tools

Hi there. In this video, we'll discuss data visualization and how it helps inform decisions for your project.

> 你好。在这个视频中，我们将讨论数据可视化以及它如何帮助项目决策。

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information to facilitate understanding. That can include graphs, maps, and tables, to name a few.

> 数据可视化是信息的图形表示，以促进理解。它可以包括图形、地图和表格等等。

Project managers use these visual representations for a few reasons. They're useful for communicating data to others because they help filter information by focusing the audience on the most important data points and insights. Visualizations are also a more efficient way to summarize information because they condense long ideas and facts into a single image or representation, and crucially, they help the viewer make sense of and remember the information being presented. Visualizations help aid information processing and enhance memory. It plays an active role in the storytelling process by helping communicate project insights to your audience.

> 项目经理使用这些视觉表示有几个原因。它们用于将数据传达给他人，因为它们通过让观众关注最重要的数据点和见解来帮助过滤信息。可视化还是一种更高效的方式来总结信息，因为它将复杂的想法和事实压缩成单个图像或表示，最重要的是，它有助于观众理解和记住所呈现的信息。可视化有助于信息处理和增强记忆。它在讲故事过程中发挥了积极的作用，帮助将项目见解传达给你的受众。

Let's go into some familiar types of data visualizations that project managers use throughout the entire life cycle of the project.

> 让我们来看看项目经理在整个项目生命周期中使用的一些常见数据可视化类型。

First, let's discuss a common data visualization tool used when running the project: a dashboard. A dashboard is a type of user interface, typically a graph or summary chart, that provides a snapshot view of your project's progress or performance. It acts as a centralized location for project stakeholders to draw quick insights. It can display a tight summary of metrics, stats, and key performance indicators, or KPIs. A KPI is a measurable value or metric that demonstrates how effective an organization is at achieving key objectives. They serve as a great aid in helping your team and stakeholders understand if you're on the right track. In other words, they signal if you're making progress to reach your success criteria. In your dashboard, you may have a summary of your top KPIs or metrics and your progress to date. For instance, if one of your objectives is for your project to reach a 95% customer satisfaction score at the end of a three-month period, you may track that goal via thousands of customer satisfaction surveys. Rather than displaying a spreadsheet of each response, a dashboard is a good place to summarize those results and showcase the average customer satisfaction score to see how you are pacing to your goal.

> 首先，让我们讨论一种在项目运行中常见的数据可视化工具：仪表板。仪表板是一种用户界面，通常是图形或摘要图表，它提供了项目进展或绩效的快照视图。它充当项目利益相关者汲取快速见解的集中位置。它可以显示指标、统计数据和关键绩效指标（KPI）的紧凑摘要。KPI是可衡量的值或指标，用来展示组织在实现关键目标方面的效能。它们对于帮助你的团队和利益相关者了解你是否在正确的轨道上起到了很大的帮助。换句话说，它们表示你是否正在取得进展以达到你的成功标准。在你的仪表板上，你可以总结你的顶级KPI或指标以及到目前为止的进展。例如，如果你的一个目标是在三个月后将项目的客户满意度得分达到95%，你可以通过成千上万份客户满意度调查来跟踪这一目标。与显示每份回应的电子表格不同，仪表板是一个很好的地方，可以总结这些结果并展示平均客户满意度得分，以了解你是否在赶上你的目标。

Similarly, you could also include other key KPIs that signify progress, like a countdown that shows the number of days until project launch or the percentage of the number of issues resolved. Many project dashboards may also summarize project plans, documents, and reports in one place and provide a visual of the status of each of them. For example, if your project plan has hundreds of tasks with varying degrees of completion, your dashboard may summarize the amount of tasks or milestones completed at that point in time and the percentage of tasks that are in progress, complete, or not started. As you may start to notice, dashboards are great visualizations for efficient status updates because they enable you to group, summarize, and highlight top project data points.

> 同样，你还可以包括其他表示进展的关键KPI，比如倒计时显示距离项目启动还有多少天，或者解决的问题数量的百分比。许多项目仪表板还可以总结项目计划、文档和报告，并提供每个项目的状态的可视化。例如，如果你的项目计划有数百个任务，完成度各不相同，你的仪表板可以总结在那个时间点完成的任务或里程碑的数量，以及正在进行、已完成或未开始的任务的百分

比。正如你可能开始注意到的，仪表板是高效的状态更新的出色可视化，因为它们使你能够对顶级项目数据点进行分组、总结和突出显示。

Another visualization that does this is one that we mentioned earlier: a burndown chart. A burndown chart is a line chart that measures the time against the amount of work done and the amount of work remaining. The outstanding work is usually on the vertical axis, with the time visualized horizontally. This serves as a strong visualization to help the team picture the amount of tasks left to complete. Similar to line charts, column charts are another popular graph used to signal project performance and progress. Column charts are useful for comparing different activities or comparing progress over time. For instance, you can show different outputs, like the number of customers and the number of plants delivered, year-over-year, to demonstrate growth in change.

> 另一个也做到这一点的可视化工具是我们之前提到的：燃尽图。燃尽图是一种线状图，它度量了所花时间与已完成的工作量以及剩余的工作量之间的关系。未完成的工作通常位于垂直轴上，时间横向可视化。这是一个强大的可视化工具，有助于团队了解剩下的任务量。与线状图类似，柱状图是另一种用于指示项目绩效和进展的常见图表。柱状图适用于比较不同的活动或比较随时间的进展。例如，你可以展示不同的输出，比如年度客户数量和交付的植物数量，以展示变化中的增长。

Pie charts are useful when showing the composition of something or the parts-to-whole relationship.

> 饼图在展示某物的构成或部分与整体的关系时非常有用。

All of these simple charts offer visualizations that enable you to draw quick insights and help tell stories. There are many more in the following reading that I recommend checking out and practicing.

> 所有这些简单的图表都提供了可视化，可以帮助你迅速获取见解并讲述故事。我建议你查阅和练习以下内容中的更多内容。

Before that, there is a final visual tool that I want you to know about, which is an infographic. Infographics are visual representations of information, such as data or facts, and are typically in the form of what we call at Google a "one-pager" or a "one-sheeter." The difference is that they're typically concise summaries of that data. This is often done primarily through graphics or drawings, emphasizing the biggest points with added text for further explanation. Use infographics to present complex information quickly, professionally, and clearly, especially when you may not be present to share all the details yourself. Infographics should be able to communicate strong information without the need for extra support and explanation.

> 在此之前，有一个最后的可视化工具我想让你知道，那就是信息图。信息图是信息（如数据或事实）的视觉表示，通常以我们在谷歌称之为“一页纸”或“一张纸”的形式呈现。不同之处在于它们通常是对这些数据的简明摘要。这通常是通过图形或图画来完成的，强调了通过附加的文本来进一步解释的要点。使用信息图可以快速、专业和清晰地呈现复杂信息，尤其是当你可能无法亲自分享所有细节时。信息图应该能够在不需要额外支持和解释的情况下传达强有力的信息。

These are just a few examples of data visualization in project management. Remember, you'll want to use visuals to demonstrate and illustrate situations like changes over time, frequency, relationship correlations, and to analyze value and risks.

> 这只是项目管理中数据可视化的一些示例。请记住，你需要使用可视化来演示和说明随时间变化、频率、关系相关性以及分析价值和风险等情况。

Another important tip is to make sure that these visualizations are accessible. As we mentioned before, you'll want to ensure that your data story is understood by everyone. Check out the resources tab on some of the best practices for accessible visualizations and communications.

> 另一个重要的提示是要确保这些可视化是可访问的。正如我们之前提到的，你需要确保每个人都能理解你的数据故事。查看关于一些可访问的可视化和通信最佳实践的资源选项卡。

Nice job! Now that you're noticing how to use data to effectively tell your story, we'll continue on to the final piece of this lesson: learning about presentation techniques to present your data. Meet you in the next video.

> 做得好！现在你已经注意到如何使用数据来有效地讲述你的故事，我们将继续学习



## Different ways to visualize data

Earlier, we discussed best practices for collecting and analyzing data. When it is time to present your data to your audience, you don’t just want to tell them about your findings and what they mean, you want to *show* them. **Data visualization** helps us organize data and turn it into information that is clear and easy for our audience to digest.

In this reading, we will go over a variety of charts and graphs you can use to visually represent data. 

**Visualizing your data**

Before translating your data into a chart or graph, you should be clear on what you want to show your audience. Figure out what data you want to use and *why.* You might want to **inform** your audience about a new trend or a valuable piece of information, or **show relationships** between data sets. Or maybe you need to **compare values,** understand the **composition** of something, or **analyze trends and behaviors over set periods of time.** 

The type of data you have, and the information you want to show or understand, will help you figure out the right data visualization to use. Let's go over some scenarios and discuss which charts and graphs would be best for each. 

**Show relationships**

A **scatter plot**, sometimes referred to as a scatter chart or scatter graph, uses dots to represent values for two different variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots will sometimes have a line drawn across its center. This line is known as the trend line and highlights the direction the points are trending towards. 

Scatter plots show the relationship between data sets, and can help us understand the impact of one factor on another. For example, the scatterplot below shows the relationship between the life expectancy of people living in a country and how happy those people are. The first variable, the happiness score, is reflected on the vertical axis —also called the **y-axis.** The second variable, life expectancy, is on the horizontal axis —also called the **x-axis.** By looking at this scatterplot, we can tell that as a person’s happiness score increases, so does their life expectancy. 



![Graph of happiness on the y-axis and health on the x-axis with a line trend and dots scattered in the top right](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/7Wf4bQ0QRnWn-G0NEGZ1Dg_8f3fa989ea3f40aab261edba5f57c626_C4M3L3R1_A.png?expiry=1698969600000&hmac=ZVGrY_fgYZIMPq1F7O-DXmC79e5vBlyzamT_mG4A7cQ)

**Scatter plot best practices:** 

- Start the y-axis at 0 to represent data accurately.

**Comparing values**

**Bar graphs** use size contrast to compare two or more values. In the example below, the time of day is compared to someone’s level of motivation throughout the whole work day. By comparing this data, we can tell that this person’s motivation is low at the beginning of the work day, and gets higher and higher by the end. Bar graphs are also a great way to clarify trends and identify patterns. 



![Bar chart signaling motivation throughout the day with bars (motivation) increasing as time increases](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/J01Dg46EQteNQ4OOhFLXMg_82a8f5b13caa40e8a410348821d35ada_C4M3L3R1_B-1-.png?expiry=1698969600000&hmac=bzTAQkJ9MYmtGR0GwvRCs7InA3L-4dm7NhyKWuLKuMQ)

**Bar graph best practices:**

- Use consistent colors throughout the chart

- Use accent colors to highlight important data points or changes over time
- Use horizontal labels so it is easier to read 

**Demonstrating composition** 

Now let’s check out another visualization you will probably recognize—the **pie chart.** Pie charts show us the **composition** of something. In other words, how much each part of something makes up the whole. The **pie chart** below shows us all the activities that make up someone’s day. Half of it is spent working, which is shown by the amount of space that the blue section takes up. From a quick glance at this pie chart, you can easily tell which activities make up a good chunk of the day and which ones take up less time.



![Pie chart of daily activities. Work showing 45% of the chart; eat, commute and watch TV show 8% and sleep is 29%](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/s2K1PuLcQQOitT7i3AEDvw_fc8fcc6169fa477bbd61e5ef51f285e1_C4M3L3R1_C.png?expiry=1698969600000&hmac=2Ynqa3dUHMG34PHtEDdOlZCl-H-3ZPSzDiYG-KJRQ5k)

**Pie chart best practices:** 

- Avoid including too many categories so it is easy to compare slices

- Make sure that the slice values add up to 100%
- Order slices according to their size

**Analyzing trends and behaviors** 

Tracking trends can help us understand shifts or changes in our data. **Line graphs** are a great tool for visually showing change over time, but they can be paired with other factors, too. In the line graph below, we are using two lines to compare the popularity of cats and dogs over a period of time. Because the graph is using two different line colors, we can instantly tell that dogs are more popular than cats. We will talk more about using colors and patterns to make visualizations more accessible to audiences later, too. Even as the lines move up and down, there is a general trend upwards, and the line for dogs always stays higher than the line for cats.



![Line chart of popularity on the y-xis and time on the x-axis. Two lines - one for dogs and one for cats trend up](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/td5XDwzqTVWeVw8M6l1Vvw_01a24f25a0784bfe94adc7cccb1a3fdd_C4M3L3R1_D.png?expiry=1698969600000&hmac=Vzmg8ET9dQz8_6m9uGwvO8XFzqCGKCacgtoQfa0Qbog)

**Line graph best practices:**

- To avoid clutter, don't show more than four categories.

- Organize highly variable data at the top of the chart to make it easy to read

Scatterplots, bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs are common data visualizations you will use throughout your career as a project manager. To practice creating these charts, check out [this step-by-step overview for creating charts using Google Sheets](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/63824?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) or this [resource](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-chart-from-start-to-finish-0baf399e-dd61-4e18-8a73-b3fd5d5680c2) for Microsoft Excel. 



## Effective presentation techniques

Hi. You've learned the process of crafting a narrative about your project, and you've learned how to visualize key data points that help you to tell that story. Now it's time to bring it all together.

> 你好。你已经学会了如何构建关于你的项目的叙述过程，以及如何可视化帮助你讲述这个故事的关键数据点。现在是时候把一切都整合在一起了。

In this video, we'll highlight some useful presentation techniques. Think about one of your favorite public speakers and why you enjoy their presentations so much. Is it their voice, their knowledge, or the confidence they exude while speaking? Brene Brown is one of my favorite speakers. She's widely known for her 2010 TED Talk, The Power of Vulnerability, which received 60 million views worldwide. Brown didn't begin her career as a public speaker, but as a research professor at the University of Houston. Today, she uses public speaking as a way to teach executives and leaders about courage and empathy.

> 在这个视频中，我们将强调一些有用的演讲技巧。想想你最喜欢的一位公开演讲者，以及你为什么那么喜欢他们的演讲。是他们的声音、知识，还是他们在演讲时流露出的自信？布伦·布朗（Brene Brown）是我最喜欢的演讲者之一。她因其2010年的TED演讲《脆弱的力量》而广为人知，在全球获得了6000万次观看。布朗并不是从事公开演讲而开始她的职业生涯，而是作为休斯敦大学的研究教授。今天，她利用公开演讲的方式教导高管和领导者有关勇气和同理心。

Public speakers spend a lot of time working on their craft. Speaking to an audience—whether to inform, entertain, or share—isn't always easy, and data alone isn't enough to convince people that you've made the right decisions or that your project was impactful. An effective presentation helps convey the important work that you and your team are accomplishing on your project. And throughout the project, you'll likely have many opportunities to present—from your initial kickoff meeting to your weekly status updates to your final project presentation.

> 公开演讲者花费大量时间来磨练他们的技艺。向观众演讲，无论是为了提供信息、娱乐还是分享，都并不总是容易的，仅凭数据并不足以说服人们你已经做出了正确的决策或者你的项目具有重大影响。一个有效的演示可以帮助传达你和你的团队在项目上所做的重要工作。而在整个项目过程中，你可能会有很多机会进行演讲，从最初的启动会议到每周的状态更新，再到最后的项目演示。

As you begin to craft your narrative, think about your audience. Ask yourself: What do I want my audience to know, think, or do as a result of this presentation? Create your presentation around the big picture, and keep it simple.

> 当你开始构建你的叙述时，要考虑你的观众。问问自己：我希望我的观众在这次演示之后知道、思考或做什么？围绕大局来创建你的演示，保持简单。

Now let's discuss three ways to help you give an effective presentation. Those are being precise, flexible, and memorable.

> 现在让我们讨论三种帮助你进行有效演示的方法。那就是要准确、灵活和令人难忘。

First, to give an effective presentation, you need to be precise about your key points. Identify the problem you're solving for your audience and remove any content that dilutes your narrative. One way I ensure that my slideshow presentations are as precise as they can be is by using a technique called "designing for five seconds." The idea is that your audience should be able to understand a slide within five seconds. So I keep my presentation slides simple, including only the most relevant data points, to avoid overloading my audience with text they don't have time to read.

> 首先，为了进行有效的演示，你需要准确地了解你的要点。确定你要为观众解决的问题，并删除任何削弱你叙述的内容。我确保我的幻灯片演示尽可能精确的一种方法是使用一种称为“五秒钟设计”的技巧。这个想法是你的观众应该能够在五秒钟内理解一张幻灯片。所以我让我的演示幻灯片保持简单，只包括最相关的数据点，以避免用他们没有时间阅读的文本来过度加载我的观众。

To give an effective presentation, you also need to be flexible. Flexibility is a huge part of your job as a project manager. For example, it's possible that a stakeholder may have to leave your presentation unexpectedly or that other attendees may arrive late. Consider the approach you'd take if you had to shorten your presentation from an hour to 30 minutes, or even just five. Know the most important points you want to make, and be prepared to share only those points, should the unexpected occur.

> 为了进行有效的演示，你还需要具备灵活性。灵活性是作为项目经理工作的重要组成部分。例如，可能会有利益相关者不得不突然离开你的演示，或者其他与会者可能会迟到。考虑一下，如果你不得不将演示从一个小时缩短到30分钟，甚至只有五分钟，你将采取什么样的方法。知道你想要表达的最重要的观点，并准备在意外发生时只分享这些观点。

Preparing

 ahead of time also helps you be more flexible when presenting. Ample preparation helps you to avoid small mistakes that can potentially distract from your narrative, like stumbling over sentences or struggling to pull up a slideshow presentation. To prepare ahead of time, you might practice delivering your presentation to members of your team and invite them to offer feedback, ask questions, or share concerns. Preparing ahead of time also gives you space to identify and come up with answers to the types of questions your audience might have about your presentation. It also gives you time to imagine and prepare for possible objections your audience might have to the decisions you want to make.

> 提前准备还有助于在演示时更加灵活。充分的准备可以帮助你避免小错误，这些错误可能会分散你叙述的注意力，比如句子结结巴巴或者努力打开幻灯片演示。提前准备时，你可以练习将你的演示交付给团队成员，并邀请他们提供反馈、提问或分享顾虑。提前准备还给了你时间去回答你的观众可能对你的演示提出的问题。它还给了你时间去想象和为你想要做出的决定可能会遇到的可能的反对意见做准备。

Lastly, be memorable. Develop a strategy that helps make your narrative unforgettable. Think back to effective storytelling. This is the point where you want to tie in your data analysis, effective visualization, and put the finishing touches on your narrative to bring it all together. Use stories or include repetition to help your audience remember the information moving forward.

> 最后，要让人难忘。制定一个帮助你叙述令人难忘的策略。回想一下有效的叙述。这是你想要将数据分析、有效的可视化紧密结合，为你的叙述做最后的润色，使它变得完美无瑕的时刻。使用故事或重复来帮助你的观众记住信息。

Another helpful tip is to be aware of your body language when presenting. Maintain an upright posture and rest your hands at your side. When making a point, try elevating your tone of voice for emphasis. Pace yourself by using intentional pauses and speak about half the speed you would normally speak while keeping your sentences short. Make eye contact with your audience and keep your facial expressions warm and friendly. Finally, have confidence. You've done the research and are well-prepared, you can set your worries aside. If you're precise, flexible, and memorable, you'll give a great presentation.

> 在演示时，另一个有用的提示是要注意你的身体语言。保持挺直的姿势，把手放在身体两侧。在表达观点时，尝试提高音调以突出重点。通过使用有意的暂停来调整自己的语速，以及保持句子简洁，来控制自己的语速。与观众保持眼神接触，保持面部表情温暖和友好。最后，要有信心。你已经做了研究，并做好了充分的准备，你可以放下担忧。如果你做到了准确、灵活和令人难忘，你将做出出色的演示。

Now that you've analyzed the data and crafted your story, your job is to present your findings effectively. Use these tips to deliver a presentation worthy of a standing ovation. In the next video, we'll wrap up and review what we've recently learned. I'll meet you over there.

## Preparing an effective presentation

At various points throughout a project, you will likely be required to deliver a presentation to team members, key stakeholders, senior leaders, or customers. Use the following tips and best practices to help you prepare an effective presentation.

**Preparation** 

**Get clear on your goals and the purpose of your presentation.**

Be clear and specific about what you want to get out of the meeting, then frame the discussion with that goal in mind. For instance, “We need two engineers who have worked in this industry before,” instead of “We need more resources.” 

**Seek input and set expectations.**

Ask your manager or check with stakeholders regarding your presentation goals. Get their input and feedback ahead of time.

- If you were invited to present, make sure you understand in advance exactly what the requestor is hoping to gain from your presentation.

**Create a delivery plan.**

Identify a headline for each slide, which is the one-sentence main point that you are trying to illustrate with that slide.

- Create a couple of supporting points that add interest to the headline, such as anecdotes, charts, data, etc.
- Build in signposts. These are ways to clue the audience in to where you are going and what to expect with your presentation.
- Limit the number of slides in the main presentation. At the same time, consider creating backup slides for potential challenges, difficult questions, trade-offs, or alternative solutions. You can hide these backup slides at the end of your presentation if you don’t need them, or add them into your presentation if you do.

**Be mindful of your audience’s time.**

Invite only participants who need to be there.

- Send the presentation ahead of time, if possible.

**Develop a strategy for making your presentation memorable.**

Use stories and repeat key points. 

- Start with a strong intro. Spend extra prep time on the beginning. The beginning is when your nerves are typically the highest, and delivering the introduction successfully can help you quickly gain confidence.



**Practice**

**Guide your audience through your presentation.** 

Help them notice what you notice, and transition between slides by using phrases like “Building on this point . . .” or “As I mentioned before . . .”

**Do a mock presentation with your team.**

If there will be more than one presenter, coordinate what each person will cover and how you will manage handoffs.

- Practice a question-and-answer (Q&A) session, anticipating the kinds of questions your participants might ask so you are prepared with a quick and confident response. In addition, practice what you will say if you are asked a question that you don’t know the answer to.
- Be prepared to run the whole meeting yourself. If a co-presenter fails to show up, are you prepared to step in?

**Schedule time to practice.**

- Once you’ve outlined what you want to say, practice it—ideally in front of a mirror—or record yourself. This may help you identify awkward phrasing that could be improved and other issues.

**Be prepared for surprises.** 

Show that you can adapt and that you know your subject matter. 

- If time runs short, can you quickly summarize the key points?
- Can you pivot the content according to what is most important to your audience?



**Presentation and pace**

**Get right to the point.** 

Identify what problem you are solving and state it up front.

- Tell the audience why you are in the room with them and what you will be covering.
- Lay down the ground rules. For example, how do you want to handle questions and comments? Will you take them throughout your presentation or afterwards?

**Check your pace.** 

Be mindful of clues from your audience and adjust accordingly.

**Follow up**

- If appropriate, send a follow up email with summary notes, action items, and time frames.
- Debrief with your manager or key audience members on what they heard from the presentation. Ask them what went well and what could have gone better.
- Review next steps.



## Making presentations accessible

Hello again. You just learned a lot about presentation best practices from my colleague. Just like you need to be strategic, prepared, and clear about which data you want to share, you also need to be intentional about ensuring your presentations are accessible and can be consumed and understood by everyone.

> 你好，又回来了。你刚刚从我的同事那里学到了很多有关演示的最佳实践。就像你需要在分享哪些数据时要有战略、做好准备并保持清晰一样，你还需要刻意确保你的演示具有可访问性，并可以被每个人消化和理解。

Let's dive into some accessibility tips to set you up for success, starting with the design of your presentation. First, create clear, simple slides. Avoid using too many graphics, too much text, or too much animation. Visual complexity makes it harder for people to absorb information during your presentation, especially for those with a visual or cognitive impairment. If your slide uses animation, make sure that you don't leave people behind by making important content disappear. If people read more slowly or rely on an interpreter, they might need a bit more time to absorb the content. Avoid using repetitive animation, like flashing or flickering, since it can be distracting and can trigger seizures. Simple doesn't have to mean boring, though. A simple slide can still be beautiful and informative. Just don't try to crowd too much information or activity into a single slide. If you generally don't use slides when giving a talk, consider giving it a try—even if you create just one slide with your main points. If you rely only on your voice, that is, you don't provide any visual accompaniment, some people might have difficulty understanding, whether because of a language barrier or hearing or cognitive impairment.

> 让我们深入探讨一些可访问性提示，以帮助你取得成功，首先从你的演示设计开始。首先，创建清晰、简洁的幻灯片。避免使用过多的图形、过多的文本或过多的动画。视觉复杂性会使人们在你的演示过程中更难吸收信息，特别是对于那些有视觉或认知障碍的人。如果你的幻灯片使用了动画，确保重要内容不会因此而消失，以免让人落后。如果人们阅读速度较慢或依赖翻译，他们可能需要更多的时间来吸收内容。避免使用重复的动画，比如闪烁或闪烁，因为这可能会分散注意力并引发癫痫。然而，简单并不意味着无聊。简单的幻灯片仍然可以既美观又信息丰富。只是不要试图将太多的信息或活动拥挤到一个幻灯片中。如果你通常在演讲时不使用幻灯片，考虑尝试一下，即使你只创建一个包含主要观点的幻灯片。如果你只依赖你的声音，也就是说，你不提供任何视觉伴随效果，一些人可能会难以理解，无论是因为语言障碍还是听力或认知障碍。

Another tip is to include alternative text, also called "alt text," for any images, drawings, or diagrams. Doing so describes the information relayed in a graphic to make it accessible to people who rely on screen readers. To add alt text in Google Slides or PowerPoint, simply select the object, right-click, and then select "alt text." The same consideration applies to charts. Charts can be difficult to decipher, especially if they use a small font in order to fit more data. If your slide includes data-heavy charts or graphs, be sure to specify the takeaway either on the slide itself or in the speaker notes.

> 另一个提示是为任何图像、图画或图表包括替代文本，也称为“alt文本”。这样做可以描述图形中传达的信息，以使依赖屏幕阅读器的人能够访问。要在Google幻灯片或PowerPoint中添加替代文本，只需选择对象，右键单击，然后选择“alt文本”。相同的考虑也适用于图表。图表可能很难解读，特别是如果它们使用小字体以适应更多的数据。如果你的幻灯片包含数据密集的图表或图形，请确保在幻灯片本身或演讲者备注中指定要点。

Next, always use text for critical information. Never rely only on color or other visual formatting to convey critical information on a chart or slide. Relying too heavily on visual formatting excludes anyone who is color-blind or unable to see the screen. For example, to highlight a new section of a flowchart, don't simply use a different color. Along with the color change, add a textual cue, such as the word "new."

> 此外，始终使用文本来传达关键信息。永远不要仅仅依赖颜色或其他视觉格式来在图表或幻灯片上传达关键信息。过于依赖视觉格式会排斥任何色盲或无法看到屏幕的人。例如，要突出显示流程图的新部分，不要仅仅使用不同的颜色

。除了颜色的改变，添加一个文本提示，比如“新”这个词。

If your presentation relies heavily on images, consider including a written summary at the end of the presentation so that people can read your main points easily in one place. Another tip is to include captions for video content and in real-time. Provide captions for all audio or video recordings shared in your presentation. If you're using a YouTube video, check that the YouTube automatic captioning is accurate. If it's not, request closed captioning through a captioning service. Use real-time captioning for your presentation, if available. Along with helping deaf or hard-of-hearing audience members, real-time captioning is useful if there are diverse accents and languages in the room, if the presenter speaks too quickly, if there are microphone issues, or if you have chatty audience members who are distracting their neighbors.

> 如果你的演示高度依赖图像，考虑在演示的最后包括一个书面摘要，以便人们可以在一个地方轻松阅读你的主要观点。另一个提示是为视频内容和实时内容提供字幕。为演示中共享的所有音频或视频记录提供字幕。如果你使用YouTube视频，请检查YouTube自动字幕是否准确。如果不准确，可以通过字幕服务请求封闭字幕。如果有可能的话，使用实时字幕进行演示。除了帮助聋人或听觉有障碍的听众，实时字幕还在以下情况下很有用：如果房间里有不同的口音和语言，如果演讲者说得太快，如果有麦克风问题，或者如果你有闲话多的听众分散了他们的邻居的注意力。

Another thing to remember is for contrast and text size, more is better. The difference between text and its background color is called contrast ratio. A high-contrast ratio makes it easier for people to read text or decipher images, especially if they're sitting far away or have low vision or color blindness. An ideal contrast ratio is 7:1. There are contrast checker tools available online, so be sure to check those out. Recommendations for text size vary, but bigger is usually better. Before your presentation begins, go to the back of the room and make sure you can read your slides. Also, the use of all capital letters makes reading texts more difficult for some people, such as people with dyslexia. When possible, avoid using all caps. This is a simple change that can go a long way.

> 另一个要记住的是，对比度和文本大小，越多越好。文本和其背景颜色之间的差异被称为对比度比例。高对比度比例使人们更容易阅读文本或解读图像，特别是如果他们坐得离屏幕很远，或者视力不佳或色盲。理想的对比度比例是7:1。网上有对比度检查工具，所以一定要检查一下。关于文本大小的建议各不相同，但通常来说，更大通常更好。在你的演示开始之前，走到房间的后面，确保你能够阅读你的幻灯片。另外，使用全大写字母会使一些人，比如患有阅读障碍的人，阅读文本更加困难。在可能的情况下，避免使用全大写。这是一个简单的改变，但可以走很远。

My final tip is to share your content in advance. If possible, send slides to your audience a few days before your presentation. This gives the audience a chance to review the content, and if needed, make arrangements to accommodate their own needs and preferences. For example, visually-impaired audience members might want to follow along with your slides on their own device with screen-reading software. If you aren't able to share your slides in advance, consider sending a document with a bulleted outline of your presentation. If you're using acronyms or technical or obscure terminology, include a glossary with definitions. This information is especially helpful for sign language interpreters and captioners. All of these best practices you just learned will help make your presentations accessible to all of your audience members. Remember, you can't communicate information effectively if your audience can't easily access it. For these and other best practices on how to make your documents and presentations more accessible, check out the resources tab. Coming up, you will learn about team communication and best practices. Good work so far! You're making real progress, and I'm excited to be a part of your journey.

> 我的最后一个提示是提前分享你的内容。如果可能的话，将幻灯片提前几天发送给你的听众。这给了观众审查内容的机会，如果需要的话，可以安排以满足他们自己的需求和偏好。例如，视障听众可能希望在自己的设备上使用屏幕阅读软件跟踪你的幻灯片。如果你无法提前分享你的幻灯片，考虑发送一个带有演示大纲的文档。如果你使用首字母缩写、技术术语或晦涩的术语，包括一个包含定义的词汇表。这些信息对手语口译员和字幕制作者尤为有用。你刚刚学到的所有这些最佳实践都将有助于使你的演示对所有听众都具有可访问性。请记住，如果你的听众无法轻松获取信息，你将无法有效地传达信息。关于如何使你的文件和演示更具可访问性的这些和其他最佳实践，请查看资源选项卡。接下来，你将学习团队沟通和最佳实践。到目前为止，你做得非常出色！你正在取得实质性的进展，我很高兴能参与你的旅程。
