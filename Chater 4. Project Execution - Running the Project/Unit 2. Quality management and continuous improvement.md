## Key quality management concepts

> 关键质量管理概念

Hi again.

In this program, we've discussed that when you're managing a project, you always have to consider the triple constraint: time, scope, and budget.

> 在这个节目中，我们讨论了当你管理一个项目时，你总是要考虑三重约束:时间、范围和预算。

Each of these three elements will impact the project, and if any one of them suffers-经受,遭受, the overall quality of the project suffers too. 

> 这三个元素中的每一个都会影响项目，如果其中任何一个受到影响，项目的整体质量也会受到影响。

There's an important distinction-差别,区分 between "quality" and "done."

> “质量”和“完成”之间有一个重要的区别。

Simply finishing a project isn't enough; the project must meet the customer's standards of quality, rather than just be completed. 

> 仅仅完成一个项目是不够的;项目必须满足客户的质量标准，而不仅仅是完成。

Like all things in project management, the more effectively you communicate with your team, the more likely your team will produce high-quality deliverables.

> 像项目管理中的所有事情一样，您与团队的沟通越有效，您的团队就越有可能产生高质量的可交付成果。

---

How do we define quality in a project management sense-意义?

> 我们如何在项目管理的意义上定义质量?

Quality is when you fulfill-履行,实现,完成 the outlined requirements for the deliverable and meet or exceed-超过,超出 the needs or expectations of your customers.

> 质量是指当你完成了可交付产品的概要要求，并满足或超过了客户的需求或期望。

When it **comes to**-谈到 quality, it's important to deliver a product or service that meets your customer's needs.

> 说到质量，提供满足客户需求的产品或服务是很重要的。

To meet their needs, you have to know important quality management concepts and oversee-监管,监督 the implementation-实施,执行 of a project management quality plan.

> 为了满足他们的需求，您必须了解重要的质量管理概念，并监督项目管理质量计划的实施。

To set yourself up for success, you should consider the four main concepts of quality management, which are: quality standards, quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.

> 为成功做好准备，你应该考虑质量管理的四个主要概念，即:质量标准、质量计划、质量保证和质量控制。

---

The quality process begins with setting quality standards.

> 质量过程从制定质量标准开始。

Quality standards provide requirements, specifications-规格,规范, or guidelines that can be used to ensure that products, processes, or services are fit for achieving the desired-渴望,期望 outcome.

> 质量标准提供了可用于确保产品、过程或服务适合实现预期结果的要求、规范或指导方针。

Set quality standards with your team and your customer at the beginning of your project.

> 在项目开始时，与您的团队和客户一起制定质量标准。

Take the time to define the quality standards and criteria-标准,准则 for your current work so that your team members and stakeholders understand exactly-精确的,确切的 what they are.

> 花时间为你当前的工作定义质量标准和标准，这样你的团队成员和利益相关者就能准确地理解它们是什么。

After you set those well-defined quality standards, you'll want to check-in periodically-定期地,周期性地 and make sure everything looks okay and the requirements are met.

> 在您设置了那些定义良好的质量标准之后，您将需要定期检查并确保一切看起来都很好并且满足了需求。

Remember that well-defined standards and requirements lead to less rework and schedule delays.

> 记住，定义良好的标准和需求可以减少返工和进度延迟。

Let's put this in an example using the scenario we've been using throughout the program.

> 让我们把它放在一个例子中，使用我们在整个项目中一直使用的场景。

You're a project manager at Office Green, a company that specializes-专门研究（或从事） in plant decor-装饰,布置 for offices and other businesses, and you're leading a project called Plant Pals, a new service that will provide top clients with desk-friendly plants.

> 你是Office Green的项目经理，这是一家专门为办公室和其他企业提供植物装饰的公司，你正在领导一个名为plant Pals的项目，这是一项新服务，将为顶级客户提供适合办公桌的植物。

Here's an example of a few quality standards for this project.

> 下面是这个项目的一些质量标准的例子。

Reliability-可靠性,可信度 standards: Each planter arrives-送达 by the agreed-upon time and in good condition-状况,状态,条件, ready to be placed at a desk.

> 可靠性标准:每台播种机按约定的时间到达，状态良好，可以放在办公桌上。

The suppliers have enough plants in their warehouses-仓库 to fulfill the customer demand-强烈要求,需要,需求 on time.

> 供应商的仓库里有足够的植物来按时满足客户的需求。

Usability standards: Planters won't cause customers allergic-对…过敏的 reactions-反应,回应 or illness-疾病 and will be suitable for all people and animals, if necessary.

> 可用性标准:花盆不会引起顾客的过敏反应或疾病，并且在必要时适用于所有人和动物。

Similarly, you may have product standards: The supplier should meet your brand's look and feel, use the specified materials, and be delivered intact-完好无损的,完整的.

> 同样，您可能有产品标准:供应商应该符合您品牌的外观和感觉，使用指定的材料，并完好无损地交付。

You should **adhere-遵守,遵循 to**-坚持 quality standards across all products and processes.

> 你应该坚持所有产品和过程的质量标准。

For instance, you may have usability standards implemented in the website development process by stating that the website must be easy to navigate, whether from a phone, computer, or tablet.

> 例如，你可以在网站开发过程中实施可用性标准，规定网站必须易于浏览，无论是通过手机、电脑还是平板电脑。

---

Next step, quality planning.

Quality planning refers specifically to the actions of a project manager or the team to establish and conduct a process for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are in fact relevant to the project as a whole, and how to satisfy them.

> 质量计划具体指的是项目经理或团队建立并执行一个过程，以确定和确定哪些质量标准实际上与整个项目相关，以及如何满足这些标准。

To steer-引导,指导 that discussion, you can ask yourself, "What outcome do my customers want at the end of this project?

> 为了引导这个讨论，你可以问自己，“我的客户在项目结束时想要什么结果?”

What does quality look like for them?

> 质量对他们来说意味着什么?

How can I meet their expectations?

How will I determine if the quality measures will lead to project success?"

> 我如何确定质量度量是否会导致项目成功?”

This is where you'll plan the procedures-程序 to achieve the quality standards.

> 这是你计划达到质量标准的程序的地方。

Recall that one of the Project Plant Pals quality standards is reliability, the expectation that each plant arrives on time and in good condition.

> 回想一下，项目工厂伙伴的质量标准之一是可靠性，期望每个植物按时到达并处于良好状态。

So as a quality planning measure, you'll need to make plans with your plant provider to test the durability-持久性,耐用性 of your planters before you decide to use them.

> 因此，作为一项质量规划措施，你需要和你的植物供应商制定计划，在你决定使用它们之前测试你的花盆的耐久性。

---

The third concept of quality management is quality assurance.

> 质量管理的第三个概念是质量保证。

Quality assurance, often shortened to QA, is all about evaluating if your project is moving towards delivering a high-quality service or product.

> 质量保证，通常简称为QA，是关于评估你的项目是否朝着提供高质量的服务或产品的方向发展。

Unlike quality standards and quality planning, QA spans-横跨,跨越 the whole project life cycle, rather than taking place at a specific phase. 

> 与质量标准和质量计划不同，QA跨越整个项目生命周期，而不是发生在特定阶段。

Your quality plan should include regular audits-审计,审查,审核 to confirm that everything is going to plan and the necessary procedures are being followed.

> 你们的质量计划应该包括定期审核，以确认一切都在按计划进行，必要的程序正在被遵循。

Regular check-ins and reporting to stakeholders will help boost-使增长,推动 their confidence, and yours, along the way.

> 定期检查和向利益相关者报告将有助于增强他们和你的信心。

Quality assurance is where you'll make sure that you and your clients are getting the exact product you contracted for.

> 质量保证就是确保你和你的客户得到的产品和你签订的合同完全一样。

So with Project Plant Pals, this is where your team will inspect-检查,审视 options for planters and perhaps **sit in**-旁听 on the durability-持久性,耐用性 testing.

> 因此，在“植物伙伴项目”中，你的团队将在这里检查花盆的选择，也许还会旁听耐久性测试。

If you make plans for your plant provider to handle the durability testing on their own, make sure you are tracking their progress and checking in regularly.

> 如果您为您的工厂供应商制定了自己处理耐久性测试的计划，请确保您跟踪他们的进度并定期检查。

---

The final concept of quality management is quality control, often shortened to QC.

> 质量管理的最后一个概念是质量控制，通常简称为QC。

Here, techniques are used in order to ensure quality standards when a problem is identified, or if the quality plan is not executed in the desired manner-方式 and corrective-纠正的,矫正的 actions should be affected.

> 在这里，当发现问题或质量计划未按期望的方式执行时，使用技术来确保质量标准，纠正措施应受到影响。

Quality control involves monitoring project results and delivery to determine if they are meeting desired results or not.

> 质量控制包括监视项目结果和交付，以确定它们是否达到预期的结果。

If not, then alternative-可替代的,备选的 actions should be taken.

> 如果没有，那么就应该采取其他措施。

Quality control is also integral-必需的,必要的 to creating a more successful landing for the next project.

> 质量控制对于下一个项目的成功落地也是不可或缺的。

After the plants are placed throughout the customers' offices, quality control may look like you or your team member taking a final walk-through of the offices where the plants were delivered.

> 在植物被放置在客户的整个办公室之后，质量控制可能看起来像您或您的团队成员在植物交付的办公室进行最后的巡视。

You'd be checking for things like broken planters or plants that were damaged in transit-运输,运送 and swapping them out when necessary. 

> 你要检查坏掉的花盆或在运输过程中损坏的植物，必要时把它们换掉。

You may not do this for every customer, but it's a good idea to do it as you're starting out in case you spot-发现 issues to improve upon when you're back in the office.

> 你可能不会对每个客户都这样做，但在你开始的时候这样做是一个好主意，以防你回到办公室后发现需要改进的问题。

If you **stuck to**-坚持 your quality plan, checking on quality throughout the life cycle of your project (QA), and of course correcting-纠正 as needed (QC), the likelihood of meeting your quality standards is high, resulting in a high-quality deliverable at the end of your project that satisfies-满足 your organizational goals and exceeds-超过,超出 the customer's expectations.

> 如果您坚持您的质量计划，在项目的整个生命周期中检查质量(QA)，当然还要根据需要进行纠正(QC)，那么满足您的质量标准的可能性就很高，从而在项目结束时产生高质量的可交付成果，满足您的组织目标并超出客户的期望。

---

And there you have it—quality management!

> 这就是质量管理!

Great!

So now we've learned more about how to identify and explain the concept of quality management, which includes quality standards, quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.

> 现在我们已经学习了更多关于如何识别和解释质量管理的概念，它包括质量标准、质量计划、质量保证和质量控制。

In the next video, we'll discuss how to use soft skills, like negotiating-谈判,磋商 and practicing empathy-共鸣,同情, to meet customers' needs in terms of quality.

> 在下一个视频中，我们将讨论如何使用软技能，比如谈判和练习同理心，来满足客户在质量方面的需求。

Meet you there!



## Recap: Quality management concepts

> 概述：质量管理概念

You are learning to define quality in your projects.

> 你正在学习如何定义项目的质量。

**Quality** is when the outlined requirements for the deliverable are fulfilled and meet or exceed the needs and expectations of customers.

> **质量**是指对可交付物的概述要求得到满足，并达到或超过客户的需求和期望。

---

In this reading, we’ll review the four main concepts of **quality management** we discussed in the previous video: quality standards, quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.

> 在这篇阅读文章中，我们将回顾我们在上一个视频中讨论的质量管理的四个主要概念：质量标准、质量计划、质量保证和质量控制。

- **Quality standards** provide requirements, specifications-规格,规范, or guidelines that can be used to ensure that products, processes, or services are fit for achieving the desired outcome. These standards must be met in order for the product, process, or service to be considered successful by the organization and the customer. You will set quality standards with your team and your customer at the beginning of your project. Well-defined standards lead to less rework and schedule delays throughout your project.

	> **质量标准**提供可用于确保产品、过程或服务适合实现预期结果的要求、规范或指南。为了使产品、过程或服务被组织和客户认为是成功的，必须满足这些标准。您将在项目开始时与您的团队和客户一起制定质量标准。定义良好的标准可以减少整个项目的返工和进度延迟。

- **Quality planning** involves the actions of you or your team to establish and conduct a process for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project as a whole and how to satisfy them. During this process, you'll plan the procedures-程序,步骤 to achieve the quality standards for your project.

	> **质量计划**涉及您或您的团队建立和实施一个过程，以确定和确定与整个项目相关的质量标准，以及如何满足这些标准。

- **Quality assurance**, or QA, is a review process that evaluates whether the project is moving toward delivering a high-quality service or product. It includes regular audits to confirm that everything is going to plan and that the necessary procedures are being followed. Quality assurance helps you make sure that you and your customers are getting the exact-确切的,精确的 product you contracted for.

	>  **质量保证**，或QA，是一个评估项目是否朝着提供高质量服务或产品的方向发展的审查过程。它包括定期审计，以确认一切按计划进行，并遵循必要的程序。质量保证可以帮助您确保您和您的客户得到的产品完全符合您的合同要求。				

- **Quality control**, or QC, involves monitoring project results and delivery to determine if they are meeting desired results. It includes the techniques that are used to ensure quality standards are maintained when a problem is identified. Quality control is a subset-子集 of quality assurance activities. While QA seeks-寻求,谋求 to prevent defects-缺陷,毛病 *before* they occur, QC aims to identify defects *after* they have happened and also entails-使必要,需要 taking corrective-纠正的,矫正的 action-措施 to resolve these issues.

	> **质量控制**，或QC，包括监控项目结果和交付，以确定它们是否达到预期的结果。它包括用于确保在发现问题时维持质量标准的技术。质量控制是质量保证活动的一个子集。QA力求在缺陷发生之前预防缺陷，而QC的目标是在缺陷发生之后识别缺陷，并采取纠正措施来解决这些问题。

## Fostering-促进,培养 customer relationships with communication skills

> 运用沟通技巧培养客户关系

By now, you probably understand that communication is paramount-至为重要的,首要的 to a project successful landing— it's the lifeblood-命脉,命根子 of the whole project.

> 到目前为止，您可能已经明白沟通对于项目的成功落地至关重要——它是整个项目的命脉。

Communication starts before the project even begins and carries-携带,进行 on steadily-逐渐地,稳步地 throughout the remainder-剩余部分 of the project.

> 沟通甚至在项目开始之前就开始了，并在项目的剩余时间里稳步进行。

In this video, I'm going to explain how using soft skills like negotiation-谈判,协商, delivering messages with empathy-同理心, and asking questions for clarity-清晰,清楚 helps to foster-促进,培养 and strengthen-巩固,加强 communication.

> 在这段视频中，我将解释如何使用软技能，比如谈判、带着同理心传递信息、问清楚问题，这些都有助于促进和加强沟通。

We'll also discuss feedback as a foundation for iterating on a product.

> 我们还将讨论反馈作为产品迭代的基础。

According to the Project Management Institute-协会, it's been found that most projects experience a communication breakdown-故障,损坏 of some kind-特征,性质, even though project managers spend about 90% of their time working on communication alone.

> 根据项目管理协会的说法，大多数项目都经历过某种形式的沟通障碍，尽管项目经理大约90%的时间都花在了沟通上。

It's in a project manager's best interest-使感兴趣 to communicate tactfully-巧妙地,机智地, not only with the members of their own organization, but also with customers and vendors.

> 项目经理最感兴趣的是，不仅与他们自己组织的成员，而且与客户和供应商进行巧妙的沟通。

When done well, strategic-战略的,策略的 communication with a customer or client can instill-徐徐滴入,逐渐灌输 a sense of confidence that you're doing a good job and that you're a trustworthy-值得信赖的,可信的 partner.

> 如果做得好，与顾客或客户的战略沟通可以灌输一种自信，你做得很好，你是一个值得信赖的合作伙伴。

---

So how should a project manager approach communication with a customer?

> 那么，项目经理应该如何与客户进行沟通呢?

Using soft skills like negotiation, empathetic listening, and trust building, will help foster a good relationship between you and your customers, and a good project manager knows how and when to apply these skills.

> 使用软技能，如谈判、移情倾听和建立信任，将有助于培养你和客户之间的良好关系，一个好的项目经理知道如何以及何时应用这些技能。

A key practice for negotiation, empathetic listening, and trust building is asking questions.

> 谈判、移情倾听和建立信任的一个关键练习就是问问题。

It's important to ask open-ended questions and actively listen to understand the customer's current state versus their desired state and what might help them get from here to there.

> 问一些开放式的问题，并积极倾听，了解客户的当前状态和他们的期望状态，以及什么可以帮助他们从这里到达那里，这一点很重要。

If you ask open-ended questions, you'll find out where you can make your customers feel more secure-安全的,稳固的,可靠的.

> 如果你问开放式的问题，你会发现你可以让你的客户感到更安全。

You'll be able to negotiate to ensure both of your needs are met, and you'll build the necessary trust to have a successful partnership.

> 你将能够通过谈判来确保双方的需求都得到满足，并且你将建立必要的信任来拥有一个成功的伙伴关系。

High-performing project managers set clear expectations about when they'll communicate certain things to their customers.

> 高绩效的项目经理会对何时与客户沟通设定明确的期望。

For example, you might want to set an expectation that you'll provide weekly progress updates to keep clients informed, rather than expecting them to come to you with questions.

> 例如，你可能想要设定一个期望，你将提供每周的进度更新，让客户了解情况，而不是期望他们来找你问问题。

When troubleshooting-解决问题 an issue with the product, it might not be necessary to fill the customer in on an issue that won't affect the outcome.

> 在对产品问题进行故障排除时，可能没有必要向客户说明不会影响结果的问题。

Let's say a designer on your team quit-退出,离开 and you had to replace-替换,更换 them, you may be able to replace that designer with a new one fairly-相当地,公平地 quickly and not even skip a beat in your project's progress.

> 假设你的团队中有一名设计师辞职了，而你必须找人接替他，你也许能够很快地用新人替换掉那个设计师，甚至不会在你的项目进程中遗漏一个节拍。

You can complete the task at hand without giving the customer any additional worry.

> 您可以完成手头的任务，而不会给客户带来任何额外的担忧。

The level of visibility between customers and clients on a given project may vary, and you'll have to use your judgment regarding-认为，把…看作 what's important to communicate to your client.

> 在给定的项目中，客户和客户之间的可见性水平可能会有所不同，您必须使用您的判断来判断与客户沟通的重要内容。

---

Sometimes, you'll want to tell your client if there's an issue.

> 有时，如果有问题，你会想告诉你的客户。

If you reach a point in the project where you can't possibly move forward without their help and input, you'll have to communicate the issue to them calmly-冷静地,平静地 and with empathy.

> 如果你在项目中遇到了没有他们的帮助和投入就无法前进的问题，你就必须冷静地和他们沟通这个问题。

Let's put this into Project Plant Pals context, where we're troubleshooting an issue with broken planters.

> 让我们把它放在植物伙伴项目的背景下，我们正在解决一个损坏的花盆的问题。

Maybe when we were putting together our quality standards, we left some room for supplier error and accounted for some broken planters.

> 也许在我们制定质量标准的时候，我们给供应商的错误留下了一些余地，并解释了一些坏掉的花盆。

We'll say we figured an acceptable number of broken planters was two out of every 50.

> 我们认为每50个花盆中有2个坏掉是可以接受的。

But let's imagine that the customer received a shipment-运输的货物 and there were five broken planters.

> 但是，让我们假设客户收到了一批货物，其中有5台坏了的种植机。

At that point, we'll need to meet with the customer and ask important negotiation questions.

> 这时，我们需要和客户见面，问一些重要的谈判问题。

We'll need to decide if the five broken planters out of every 50 is an acceptable outcome, or we'll need to discuss whether the customer would consider investing-投资,投入 in a higher tier-层次,等级 of planters that may be less prone-易于…的 to breaking.

> 我们需要决定每50个花盆中有5个坏掉是否是一个可以接受的结果，或者我们需要讨论客户是否会考虑投资更高层次的花盆，这样更不容易坏掉。

Presenting-呈现 a solution like using sturdier-结实的,坚固的 planters will affect their budget, and they'll need to adjust accordingly.

> 提出一个解决方案，比如使用更结实的花盆，会影响他们的预算，他们需要做出相应的调整。

---

Is the customer okay with that change? Would that lead to another trade off?

> 客户对这样的改变有意见吗?这会导致另一种交易吗?

Keeping in mind that the main goal here is customer satisfaction throughout the negotiation process, you'll want to be considerate of their feelings and limitations.

> 请记住，在整个谈判过程中，主要目标是让客户满意，你要考虑到他们的感受和局限性。

You can do this by exhibiting-展出 empathy: understanding their frustrations-懊恼,沮丧, addressing them, and finding a solution that's beneficial for both of you.

> 你可以通过表现出同理心来做到这一点:理解他们的挫折，解决他们的问题，找到一个对你们双方都有利的解决方案。

You may have held a customer-facing role in the past, whether that's in a call center, as a retail-零售 associate-助理, as a server in a restaurant, or any number of positions-职位.

> 你可能在过去担任过面向客户的角色，无论是在呼叫中心、零售助理、餐厅服务员，还是其他任何职位。

Even if you haven't, you've probably been an advocate-拥护,提倡 for yourself while conversing-谈话,交谈 with a customer service representative-代表,代理人. 

> 即使你没有，你也可能在与客户服务代表交谈时为自己辩护过。

Because of this, you'll probably have a good idea of what good customer service looks like.

> 正因为如此，你可能会对什么是好的客户服务有一个很好的想法。

Good customer service results in choosing to go back to the same hair salon, bakery-面包店, or coffee shop because you liked the way that you were treated and the service you received (even if you had an issue), versus choosing not to go back to those places if you don't receive that level of care.

> 良好的客户服务会让你选择再去同一家发廊、面包店或咖啡店，因为你喜欢他们对待你的方式和服务(即使你遇到了问题)，而不是选择不去那些地方，如果你没有得到那样的服务水平。

Your past experiences have taught you to manage relationships and to avoid delivering something that's low quality.

> 你过去的经历教会了你如何管理人际关系，避免交付低质量的东西。

It doesn't feel great when you're on the receiving end.

> 当你被人欺负的时候感觉不太好。

In order to yield-产生 better results in future projects, it's necessary to get feedback from customers.

> 为了在未来的项目中取得更好的成果，有必要从客户那里获得反馈。

Sometimes, this feedback will come during the process, and sometimes, it'll come after the project is completed, depending on how you map it out in the initiation phase.

> 有时，这种反馈会在过程中出现，有时，它会在项目完成后出现，这取决于您在初始阶段如何规划它。

The matter of when you receive feedback may come down to what you actually want to accomplish in your project.

> 何时收到反馈的问题可能取决于你在项目中真正想要完成什么。

If your business is launching an e-commerce-电子商务 site, you will want user feedback so you can make adjustments to optimize the customers' shopping experience.

> 如果你的企业正在推出一个电子商务网站，你会想要用户的反馈，这样你就可以做出调整，优化客户的购物体验。

If your business is an on-demand-请求式 cookie delivery service, you may want to deliver the cookies and then get user feedback to know how your customers felt-感受到,体会到 about the cookies and the delivery experience as a whole.

> 如果您的业务是按需提供cookie交付服务，您可能希望交付cookie，然后获得用户反馈，以了解您的客户对cookie和交付体验的整体感受。

User feedback helps to close any gaps-差距 and understanding between the customer's expectation and the project's needs.

> 用户反馈有助于缩小客户期望和项目需求之间的差距和理解。

---

So to summarize very briefly, soft skills like negotiation, empathetic listening, and trust-building will help create a good relationship between you and your customers, and getting feedback from those customers will help you to iterate on a product or service.

> 所以简单地总结一下，软技能，如谈判、移情倾听和建立信任将有助于在你和客户之间建立良好的关系，从这些客户那里获得反馈将有助于你迭代产品或服务。

That's a lot of information—great job taking it all in!

> 信息量太大了，你把所有的信息都吸收了!

We'll get a little more specific with user testing and feedback in the next video.

> 我们将在下一个视频中更具体地介绍用户测试和反馈。

I'll meet you there.



## Measuring customer satisfaction

> 测量顾客满意度

Hi again!

As promised-承诺, we're going to discuss user testing and feedback.

> 正如承诺的那样，我们将讨论用户测试和反馈。

If the end goal of our project is to have a great quality product or service for both our own organization and our customer, we need to get an idea of what the customer wants.

> 如果我们项目的最终目标是为我们自己的组织和客户提供高质量的产品或服务，我们需要了解客户想要什么。

We already learned how to make sure something is high quality on our end.

> 我们已经学会了如何确保我们的产品是高质量的。

---

Now let's find out how to measure what clients want, so we can meet their needs, expectations, and standards.

> 现在让我们来看看如何衡量客户想要什么，这样我们就可以满足他们的需求、期望和标准。

The best way to get an idea of what customers and users want is to ask them, but we don't mean calling each of them up on the phone and literally-真正地,确实地 asking them.

> 了解客户和用户想要什么的最好方法是询问他们，但我们并不是说给他们每个人打电话，直接询问他们。

That might not be the best use of our time.

> 这可能不是利用时间的最佳方式。

Fortunately, there are a few ways we can streamline-精简,使效率更高 that information.

> 幸运的是，我们有一些方法可以简化这些信息。

We can conduct a series-一系列 of surveys or tests with customers and users.

> 我们可以对客户和用户进行一系列的调查或测试。

Some common ones are feedback surveys and user acceptance-验收,认可,容忍 tests.

> 一些常见的方法是反馈调查和用户验收测试。

---

Let's start with feedback surveys.

> 让我们从反馈调查开始。

Feedback surveys are a survey in which users provide feedback on features of your product that they like or dislike.

> 反馈调查是指用户对你的产品中他们喜欢或不喜欢的特性提供反馈的调查。

These surveys can **take place**-发生,进行 as you design, before you launch, in order to find out if people like and understand the product, or after you've launched, if you want to make sure the user experience-体验 is even more satisfying.

> 这些调查可以在你设计的时候进行，在你发布之前进行，以了解人们是否喜欢和理解你的产品，或者在你发布之后进行，如果你想确保用户体验更令人满意的话。

So your users participate in a survey and give you feedback on what features they like or dislike, and potentially, which aspects they find to be fairly intuitive-易懂的,使用简便的, and which aspects are a little tougher-艰难的 to navigate-操作.

> 因此，您的用户参与调查，并向您反馈他们喜欢或不喜欢的功能，以及他们认为哪些方面相当直观，哪些方面更难操作。

After you get that feedback, you'll either be good to launch, if you haven't yet, or you'll go back and iterate on the product, if it's already on the market.

> 在你得到反馈后，如果你还没有发行游戏，你就可以开始发行了;如果你的产品已经上市了，你就可以回头对其进行迭代。

---

Alternatively-要不,或者, you might conduct user acceptance-验收 tests.

> 或者，您可以执行用户验收测试。

In broader-广大的,广阔的 terms-术语,措辞, a user acceptance test, or a UAT, is a test that helps a business make sure that a product or solution works for its users.

> 从广义上讲，用户验收测试(UAT)是一种帮助企业确保产品或解决方案对其用户有效的测试。

A UAT must meet the agreed upon requirements and deliver the expected results.

> UAT必须满足商定的需求并交付预期的结果。

This test is typically used to assess the end-to-end experience for the user of a new process or product.

> 该测试通常用于评估新流程或产品用户的端到端体验。

A user acceptance test is incredibly-难以置信地,非常地 important because it **takes place**-发生,举行 near the end of a product's development, and therefore, is an overall user experience test of the entire product, software, or service.

> 用户验收测试非常重要，因为它发生在产品开发的最后阶段，因此是对整个产品、软件或服务的整体用户体验测试。

UATs are sometimes referred to as "beta tests."

> UATs 有时被称为“beta测试”。

Let's find out what a user acceptance test agenda might look like.

> 让我们来看看用户验收测试议程是什么样的。

In a typical UAT setting, you'll welcome your users and thank them for participating.

> 在典型的UAT设置中，您将欢迎用户并感谢他们的参与。

Then, you'll present the product to them.

> 然后，你将向他们展示产品。

This includes discussing testing guidelines and demonstrating how the product works.

> 这包括讨论测试指南和演示产品如何工作。

Next, you'll start your UAT test cases, taking your audience through critical user journeys.

> 接下来，您将开始您的UAT测试用例，带领您的受众通过关键的用户旅程。

A critical user journey is a sequence of steps a user follows to accomplish tasks in your product.

> 关键的用户旅程是用户完成产品任务所遵循的一系列步骤。

When presenting something you've built, you must give users a visual representation-表现 or **mock up**-模型 of your product or have them go through a demo.

> 当展示你所构建的东西时，你必须给用户一个产品的视觉表现或模型，或者让他们看一个演示。

For example, if you're working on a construction-based project and you intend to replace all appliances-家用电器,装置 and hardware in the home, you'll want to give the user some sort of vision of what that might entail.

> 例如，如果你正在从事一个以建筑为基础的项目，你打算更换家里所有的电器和硬件，你会想要给用户一些关于可能需要做什么的设想。

This could include 3D models, digital blueprints, samples, and more.

> 这可能包括3D模型、数字蓝图、样品等等。

Your UAT demo should focus on a call to action.

> 你的UAT演示应该专注于号召行动。

For instance, the call to action for your project may be the need to test hardware in the client's future home.

> 例如，您项目的行动号召可能是需要在客户未来的家中测试硬件。

Maybe the homeowners have requested a dishwasher-洗碗机 that can be opened and closed with very little force-力,力量 and doesn't make too much noise.

> 也许房主要求的洗碗机，可以打开和关闭很小的力量，没有太大的噪音。

In that case, you'll want to give the client real-life scenarios to work within.

> 在这种情况下，您需要为客户提供真实的工作场景。

Ask them to load the dishes and start the wash cycle.

> 让他们把盘子装好，开始洗碗。

Then ask questions like, "On a scale of one to 10, how much force was required to open and close the dishwasher?" to determine if the washer meets their expectations.

> 然后问一些问题，比如“从1到10，打开和关闭洗碗机需要多大的力?”来确定洗衣机是否符合他们的期望。

During your presentation-演示 and walkthrough-演练 of the UAT, you should be collecting feedback from the users on their overall experience.

> 在演示和演练UAT期间，您应该收集用户对其总体体验的反馈。

During this part of testing, your users will be able to help you identify edge-边,边缘 cases.

> 在测试的这一部分中，您的用户将能够帮助您识别边缘情况。

Edge cases are rare-少见的,罕见的—outliers that the original requirements didn't account for.

> 边缘情况是原始需求没有考虑到的罕见的异常情况。

They deal with the extreme-极端的 maximums and minimums of parameters.

> 它们处理参数的极端最大值和最小值。

For example, imagine that you created an app that allows for unlimited photo uploads, knowing that users will rarely-罕有,很少 upload more than 1000 photos in a single session.

> 例如，假设您创建了一个允许无限上传照片的应用程序，知道用户很少在单个会话中上传超过1000张照片。

How will the system deal with someone who actually does upload thousands of photos, or millions, in a single upload?

> 如果有人在一次上传中上传了数千张或数百万张照片，系统将如何处理?

It's unlikely, but it could be disastrous-灾难性的,使损失惨重的 for your software.

> 这不太可能，但它可能对您的软件造成灾难性的影响。

After identifying edge cases, the last step of the UAT agenda is to recap your findings, identify bugs or issues, and prioritize which issues need to be addressed first.

> 在确定了边缘情况之后，UAT议程的最后一步是重述您的发现，识别错误或问题，并确定需要首先解决的问题的优先级。

When you've addressed the issue and determined next steps, you'll be able close and conclude-结束,终止 your user acceptance testing.

> 当您解决了问题并确定了下一步时，您就可以结束并结束用户验收测试。

And there you have it!

> 这就是答案!

So we've learned a bit more about the importance of listening to feedback from customers and discussed some common methods for measuring customer satisfaction, like feedback surveys, user acceptance tests, and edge cases.

> 因此，我们已经了解了更多关于倾听客户反馈的重要性，并讨论了一些测量客户满意度的常用方法，如反馈调查、用户验收测试和边缘案例。

That's a lot to learn.

Keep it up!

You're doing great so far!

In our next video, we'll pivot to identifying reasons why risks and changes might occur and how to manage dependencies.

> 在下一个视频中，我们将重点讨论确定风险和变更可能发生的原因，以及如何管理依赖关系。

I'll see you soon.



## Ensuring accessibility during feedback collection

> 确保反馈收集过程中的可访问性

Hello again!

I'm Holly.

If you've been following this program from start to finish, you may remember me from an earlier course where I shared a bit about accessibility and why it's so important to keep it in mind as a project manager.

> 如果你从头到尾都在遵循这个程序，你可能还记得我在之前的课程中分享过一些关于可访问性的内容，以及为什么作为项目经理记住它是如此重要。

So far, you've learned the importance of managing, communicating, and measuring quality.

> 到目前为止，您已经了解了管理、沟通和度量质量的重要性。

This is a great opportunity to also think about how to ensure the ways you are collecting feedback and the processes in place to measure quality are fair and accessible.

> 这也是一个很好的机会，让你思考如何确保你收集反馈的方式和衡量质量的过程是公平和可访问的。

First, if you are collecting feedback through live-现场 interviews, be sure to include an offer-提供 to provide accommodations-住宿,空间,座位 in your correspondence-信件 when setting up the sessions.

> 首先，如果你是通过现场面试收集反馈，在安排面试时，一定要在你的信件中包括提供住宿的提议。

You may get requests for live captioning-字幕 or an interpreter-翻译.

> 您可能会收到现场字幕或翻译的请求。

Other folks-人们, such as those with anxiety-焦虑,忧虑 or on the autism-孤独症,自闭症 spectrum, may ask to see the questions in advance-预先的,事先的 so that they have time to think about and prepare their answers.

> 另外一些人，比如那些患有焦虑症或自闭症的人，可能会要求提前看一下问题，这样他们就有时间思考和准备答案。

Remember, what works for one person may not work for another person, even if those two people have the same disability.

> 记住，适用于一个人的方法不一定适用于另一个人，即使这两个人有同样的残疾。

If you're conducting an interview on location, examine the space with an accessibility lens, like ensuring there's an accessible path into the building and to the room and that hallways are clear of clutter that could block someone using a wheelchair-轮椅 or a walker or someone with a visual impairment-缺陷,障碍 from easily and safely moving through.

> 如果你在现场进行面试，用无障碍镜头检查空间，比如确保有一条进入建筑物和房间的通道，走廊上没有杂物，这些杂物可能会阻碍使用轮椅或助行器的人或视力障碍的人轻松安全地通过。

If sending a survey or collecting feedback using technology, check that the systems you are using are fully accessible.

> 如果使用技术发送调查或收集反馈，请检查您正在使用的系统是否完全可访问。

If you're unsure, contact the system owner and ask if they are compliant-符合的,一致的 with the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG.

> 如果您不确定，请联系系统所有者并询问它们是否符合最新的Web内容可访问性指南(WCAG)。

Be prepared to provide questions and collect responses in an alternate-轮流的,交替的 manner-方式, if needed.

> 如果需要，准备好以另一种方式提出问题和收集回答。

Beyond collecting feedback, as a project manager, it's important for you to make accessibility part of the conversation from the beginning, especially if your project **pertains to**-关于 a process or a product.

> 除了收集反馈，作为一个项目经理，从一开始就把可访问性作为谈话的一部分是很重要的，尤其是当你的项目涉及到一个过程或一个产品时。

Oftentimes, incorporating-合并的 accessible features into a product is overlooked-忽视,忽略 or left to the final stages of a project.

> 通常，将可访问特性合并到产品中会被忽略，或者留到项目的最后阶段。

and can lead to serious-严重的 implications-可能的影响, like launch delays, or worse, a product that can't be used by a percentage of the population-人. 

> 这可能会导致严重的影响，比如发布延迟，或者更糟的是，一款产品无法被一定比例的人使用。

Ensure your developers are familiar with accessibility requirements at the start.

> 确保您的开发人员在一开始就熟悉可访问性需求。

If they're not, help connect them with appropriate-合适的,相称的 resources or experts.

> 如果不是，帮助他们联系合适的资源或专家。

Include testers with various disabilities-残疾 in your usability testing whenever possible, and at the very least, have the product tested for adherence-遵守,坚持 to accessibility guidelines.

> 只要有可能，在可用性测试中包括各种残疾的测试人员，至少，测试产品是否符合可访问性指导原则。

In summary, think about accessibility early and often, and encourage others on your project team to do so, too.

> 总之，尽早并经常考虑可访问性，并鼓励项目团队中的其他人也这样做。

Coming up, you will practice ways to measure quality and learn more about managing changes, risk, and so much more.

> 接下来，您将练习度量质量的方法，并学习更多关于管理变更、风险等的知识。

Keep up the great work.





## User acceptance testing: Goals, best practices, and management

> 用户验收测试:目标、最佳实践和管理

In a previous video, you learned about different ways to measure customer satisfaction, including feedback surveys and **user acceptance testing (UAT)**.

> 在之前的视频中，您了解了衡量客户满意度的不同方法，包括反馈调查和用户验收测试(UAT)。

This reading will focus on why conducting UAT is essential to the successful launch of any product, service, or software.

> 这篇文章将重点介绍为什么进行UAT对于任何产品、服务或软件的成功发布都是至关重要的。

We will also discuss some best practices for effective UAT and how to manage the feedback you receive. 

> 我们还将讨论有效的UAT的一些最佳实践，以及如何管理您收到的反馈。

**The goals of UAT**

To recap, UAT is testing that helps a business make sure that a product, service, or process works for its users.

> 简而言之，UAT是帮助企业确保产品、服务或流程对其用户有效的测试。

The main objectives of UAT are to:

- Demonstrate that the product, service, or process is behaving in expected ways in real-world scenarios. 

	> 演示产品、服务或流程在实际场景中以预期的方式运行。

- Show that the product, service, or process is working as intended-预期的.

	> 表明产品、服务或过程按预期工作。

- Identify issues that need to be addressed before project completion.

	> 在项目完成之前确定需要解决的问题。

UAT simulates-模拟,模仿 real-world conditions, so when the feature works as intended-预期的 during the testing process, you can be more confident that your product, service, or process will work properly once it is launched.

> UAT模拟真实世界的条件，因此，当该功能在测试过程中按预期工作时，您可以更加确信您的产品、服务或流程在启动后将正常工作。

It allows a project team to gather detailed information about how users interact with a product, service, or process.

> 它允许项目团队收集有关用户如何与产品、服务或流程交互的详细信息。

UAT helps the team answer such questions as: Do users recognize its purpose and uses?

> UAT帮助团队回答以下问题:用户是否认识到它的目的和用途?

How do they interact with it?

> 它们是如何相互作用的?

How much time do users take to interact with it?

> 用户需要花多少时间与它进行交互?

Do they notice all of its features?

> 他们注意到它的所有特征了吗?

Is the product, service, or process accessible to everyone?

> 产品、服务或流程是否人人都能访问?

UAT also allows the project team to record information about how users feel about their experience with a product, service, or process.

> UAT还允许项目团队记录有关用户对产品、服务或流程体验的感受的信息。

Through testing, the team can learn about the emotions-情感,情绪 it evokes-引起,唤起, identities it conveys-表达,传递, appeal-吸引力,感染力 it holds, and so on.

> 通过测试，团队可以了解它所唤起的情感、它所传达的身份、它所拥有的吸引力等等。

**Best practices for effective UAT**

> 有效UAT的最佳实践

In order to achieve these goals, UAT needs to be conducted thoughtfully.

> 为了实现这些目标，需要深思熟虑地进行UAT。

These best practices can help you administer-管理,治理 effective UAT: 

> 以下最佳做法可以帮助您有效地管理UAT:

- **Define and write down your acceptance criteria**.  

	> 定义并写下你的验收标准。

	**Acceptance criteria** are pre-established standards or requirements that a product, service, or process must meet.

	> 验收标准是预先建立的标准或要求，产品、服务或过程必须满足这些标准或要求。

	Write down these requirements for each item that you intend-打算,想要 to test.

	> 写下你打算测试的每个项目的这些要求。

	For example, if your project is to create a new employee handbook for your small business, you may set acceptance criteria that the handbook must be a digital PDF that is accessible on mobile devices and desktop.

	> 例如，如果您的项目是为您的小型企业创建新的员工手册，您可以设置接受标准，即手册必须是可在移动设备和桌面设备上访问的数字PDF。

- **Create the test cases for each item that you are testing**. 

	> 为您正在测试的每个项目创建测试用例

	A **test case** is a sequence of steps and its expected results. 

	> 测试用例是一系列步骤及其预期结果。

	It usually consists-由…组成,由…构 of a series of actions that the user can perform to find out if the product, service, or process behaved the way it was supposed-预期的 to.

	> 它通常由一系列操作组成，用户可以通过这些操作来发现产品、服务或流程是否按照预期的方式运行。

	Continuing with the employee handbook example, you could create a test case process in which the user would click to download the PDF of the handbook on their mobile device or desktop to ensure that they could access it without issues.

	> 继续员工手册示例，您可以创建一个测试用例流程，在该流程中，用户将单击以在其移动设备或桌面上下载手册的PDF，以确保他们可以毫无问题地访问它。

- **Select your users carefully**.

	> 仔细选择您的用户

	It is important to choose users who will actually be the end users of the product, service, or process. 

	> 选择真正成为产品、服务或流程最终用户的用户是很重要的。

- **Write the UAT scripts based on user stories**.  

	> 根据用户故事编写UAT脚本

	These scripts will be delivered to the users during the testing process.

	> 这些脚本将在测试过程中交付给用户。

	A **user story** is an informal-非正式的, general explanation-解释,说明 of a feature written from the perspective-视角,观点 of the end user.

	> 用户故事是从最终用户的角度对功能进行的非正式的、一般的解释。

	In our employee handbook example, a user story might be: As a new employee, I want to be able to use the handbook to easily locate-找出 the vacation policy and share it with my team via email. 

	> 在我们的员工手册示例中，用户故事可能是:作为一名新员工，我希望能够使用手册轻松地找到休假政策，并通过电子邮件与我的团队共享。

- **Communicate with users and let them know what to expect**.

	> 与用户沟通，让他们知道什么是期望

	If you can prepare users ahead-提前,预先 of time, there will be fewer-很少 questions, issues, or delays during the testing process.

	> 如果您可以提前让用户做好准备，那么在测试过程中就会有更少的问题、问题或延迟。

- **Prepare the testing environment for UAT**.  

	> 为 UAT 准备测试环境

	Ensure that the users have proper credentials-资格,证明 and access, and try out these credentials ahead of time to ensure they work. 

	> 确保用户具有适当的凭据和访问权限，并提前试用这些凭据以确保它们能够正常工作。

- **Provide a step-by-step plan to help guide users through the testing process.**  

	> 提供一个循序渐进的计划来帮助指导用户完成测试过程。

	It will be helpful for users to have some clear, easy-to-follow instructions-指令,说明 that will help focus their attention on the right places.

	> 对于用户来说，有一些清晰、易于遵循的说明将有助于他们将注意力集中在正确的地方。

	You can create this plan in a digital document or spreadsheet and share with them ahead of time. 

	> 你可以在数字文档或电子表格中创建这个计划，并提前与他们分享。

- **Compile notes in a single document and record any issues that are discovered**.  

	> 将注意事项汇编成一份文件，并记录发现的任何问题。

	You can create a digital spreadsheet or document that corresponds to your plan.

	> 你可以创建一个与你的计划相对应的电子表格或文档。

	It can have designated areas to track issues for each item that is tested, including the users’ opinions-意见,看法 on the severity-严重,严重性 of each issue.

	> 它可以指定区域来跟踪每个被测试项目的问题，包括用户对每个问题严重性的意见。

	This will help you prioritize fixes. 

	> 这将帮助您确定修复的优先级。

**Managing UAT feedback**

> 管理UAT反馈

Users provide feedback after performing UAT.

> 用户在执行UAT后提供反馈。

This feedback might include positive comments, bug reports, and change requests.

> 这些反馈可能包括积极的评论、bug报告和变更请求。

As the project manager, you can address the different types of feedback as follows:

> 作为项目经理，您可以处理以下不同类型的反馈:

- **Bugs or issues:**

	Users might report technical issues, also known as **bugs**, or other types of issues after performing UAT.

	You can track and monitor these issues in a spreadsheet or equivalent-等同的,等效的 system and prioritize which issues to fix.

	> 您可以在电子表格或类似的系统中跟踪和监控这些问题，并优先考虑要解决的问题。

	For instance, critical issues, such as not being able to access, download, or search the employee handbook, need to be prioritized over non-critical issues, such as feedback on the cover art of the handbook. 

	> 例如，关键问题，如不能访问、下载或搜索员工手册，需要优先于非关键问题，如对手册封面的反馈。

- **Change requests:**

	Sometimes the user might suggest minor-轻微的,微小的 changes to the product, service, or process after UAT.

	> 有时，用户可能会建议在UAT之后对产品、服务或流程进行微小的更改。

	These types of requests or changes should also be managed and prioritized.

	> 还应该对这些类型的请求或更改进行管理并确定优先级。

	Depending on the type and volume-总数,总量 of the requests, you may want to share this data with your primary stakeholders, and you may also need to adjust your project timeline to implement these new requests. 

	> 根据请求的类型和数量，您可能希望与主要涉众共享此数据，并且您可能还需要调整项目时间表以实现这些新请求。

**Key takeaway**

User acceptance testing is a powerful tool to ensure that your project outcome is desirable-令人向往的,值得拥有的 and successful.

> 用户验收测试是一个强大的工具，可以确保您的项目结果是理想的和成功的。

Be sure to leave time in the schedule for proper-适当的 testing and issue resolution-解决. 

> 确保在计划中留出时间进行适当的测试和问题解决。



## Sue: The importance of understanding customer needs

> 苏：了解客户需求的重要性

Hi. I'm Sue.

I'm a technical program manager for Google's support platform.

> 我是谷歌支持平台的技术项目经理。

A technical program manager is responsible for making sure the team delivers on what it sets out to do.

> 技术项目经理负责确保团队交付它所设定的任务。

That means pulling together a lot of different capabilities and deliverables coming from across many teams to pull together a product that we deliver to our customers.

> 这意味着将来自多个团队的许多不同的功能和可交付成果整合在一起，从而将我们交付给客户的产品整合在一起。

Without customers, there's really no reason to be building anything.

> 没有客户，我们真的没有理由去做任何事情。

And what's interesting about building projects and working with customers and trying to imagine what they want, is it puts you in this really unique place where you need to put yourself in their shoes-他人的处境 and imagine the world or imagine the product through their eyes.

> 建立项目，与客户合作，尝试想象他们想要什么，有趣的是，这让你处于一个非常独特的位置，你需要设身处地地为他们着想，通过他们的眼睛想象世界或想象产品。

In a project management role, being able to empathize-有同感,起共鸣 and understand how different people in the world will interact with your product is really important and gives you this amazing perspective-视角,观点.

> 在一个项目管理的角色中，能够移情，理解世界上不同的人如何与你的产品互动是非常重要的，这给了你这个惊人的视角。

Understanding the customer's needs is a very difficult job, but it's really important.

> 了解客户的需求是一项非常困难的工作，但它确实很重要。

I believe it's a skill you can develop **over time**-逐渐地.

> 我相信这是一种你可以慢慢培养的技能。

I actually consider a customer just a certain kind of stakeholder.

> 实际上，我认为客户只是某种利益相关者。

I like to take my stakeholders and group them into buckets, so I have customers, and they are usually the end users of a product or the ones that are purchasing the product.

> 我喜欢把我的利益相关者分成几个小组，所以我有客户，他们通常是产品的最终用户或购买产品的人。

And then I have stakeholders that are sponsors, rather—the people that are funding-资助 the team that's actually building this.

> 然后我有一些利益相关者，他们是赞助商，他们是资助团队的人，他们实际上是在建造这个。

Those two groups of people are very different, and I like to treat a sponsor in a very special way.

> 这两类人非常不同，我喜欢以一种非常特殊的方式对待赞助商。

They are looking to increase their return on investment-投资, and so you always need to be **looking for**-寻找 ways to quantify-量化, how are you generating a return on that investment?

> 他们希望增加他们的投资回报，所以你总是需要寻找量化的方法，你如何产生投资回报?

There's always this little fear that they're not going to get what they paid for, and giving them information frequently and at the right level of detail is a really important skill to have as a project manager.

> 总有一点担心他们不会得到他们所付的钱，经常给他们提供信息，在适当的细节水平上是一个项目经理非常重要的技能。

Sometimes you can overwhelm-压垮 them with too many details and they cannot see the forest-森林,林区 through the trees, and sometimes you don't give them enough detail, and they don't trust what you're telling them.

> 有时你用太多的细节让他们不知所措，他们无法透过树木看到森林，有时你没有给他们足够的细节，他们不相信你告诉他们的。

And so striking-达到（平衡） that balance is really important.

> 所以保持平衡是非常重要的。

I really enjoy seeing a project from the very beginning to the very end, when you actually get to show it to a customer and get their acknowledgment-感谢,承认 and recognition-接受,表彰 and see their excitement at seeing the product actually working; something that, when you just started, there was nothing—just ideas and maybe some papers.

> 我真的很喜欢看到一个项目从开始到结束，当你真正把它展示给客户，得到他们的认可和认可，看到他们看到产品实际工作时的兴奋;当你刚开始的时候，什么都没有，只有一些想法和一些论文。

Then, however many months later you actually have a product that you can show off.

> 然后，不管过了多少个月，你都有了一个可以炫耀的产品。

What I love about project management is it puts you in that role, so you can really-真正地 see things from the beginning to the end.

> 我喜欢项目管理的一点是，它把你放在那个角色上，所以你可以从开始到结束真正地看到事情。



# Pursuing-追求,致力于 continuous improvement

> 追求持续改善

## Continuous improvement and process improvement

> 持续改进和过程改进

In this video, we'll explore how to advocate-拥护,提倡 for and create continuous improvements in a project by learning about process improvements.

> 在本视频中，我们将通过学习过程改进来探索如何在项目中倡导和创建持续改进。

Continuous improvement is an ongoing effort to improve products or services.

> 持续改进是指不断努力改进产品或服务。

It helps ensure that a product steadily-逐渐地,稳步地 makes its way toward the best possible outcome.

> 它有助于确保产品稳定地朝着可能的最佳结果前进。

Continuous improvement begins with recognizing when processes and tasks need to be created, eliminated-淘汰,剔除, or improved.

> 持续改进始于认识到何时需要创建、消除或改进过程和任务。

Then a project manager must plan for and implement-执行,贯彻 changes to keep the project on track.

> 然后，项目经理必须计划并实施变更，以保持项目的正常进行。

That's where process improvement comes from.

> 这就是过程改进的来源。

---

Process improvement is the practice of identifying, analyzing, and improving existing processes to enhance-提高,改善 the performance-性能,绩效 of your team and to develop best practices or to optimize-优化 consumer experiences.

> 过程改进是识别、分析和改进现有过程的实践，以增强您的团队的性能，并开发最佳实践或优化消费者体验。

When working with your process improvements, using a controlled environment in an experiment-试验,尝试 can help you understand if the changes you're considering fix your problem.

> 在处理过程改进时，在实验中使用受控环境可以帮助您了解正在考虑的更改是否解决了问题。

A control is an experiment or observation designed to minimize the effects of variables-变量.

> 控制是为了尽量减少变量的影响而设计的实验或观察。

Control groups are representative-有代表性的 samples that help you to determine that the differences between your experimental groups and the norm are due to your changes, rather than something else.

> 控制组是具有代表性的样本，它可以帮助您确定实验组与规范之间的差异是由于您的变化造成的，而不是其他原因。

They eliminate-剔除,淘汰 alternative-可替代的 explanations-解释,说明,理由,原因 for your results.

> 它们排除了对结果的其他解释。

If you aren't familiar with this, that's okay, because I'll break it down for you.

> 如果你不熟悉这个，没关系，因为我会为你解释。

For example, you observe a problem with your process and **put forward**-提出 a hypothesis-假设, which is an educated-教育 guess-猜测,推测 about what's causing the problem and how you'd fix it.

> 例如，您观察到流程中的问题并提出假设，这是关于导致问题的原因以及如何解决问题的有根据的猜测。

Then you change one variable in the system, keeping the control group the same, and observe your results again.

> 然后你改变系统中的一个变量，保持对照组不变，再次观察你的结果。

---

Let's put this in the context of Project Plant Pal scenario.

> 让我们把它放在植物伙伴计划的背景下。

Business is booming for Office Green, and demand-强烈要求,需要,需求 for your team's new Plant Pal service is rapidly-快速地,迅速地 growing.

> Office Green的业务正在蓬勃发展，对您团队的新Plant Pal服务的需求正在迅速增长。

To meet the demand, suppliers have streamlined-精简 their process of packing boxes and putting all plants into a one-size-fits-all box. 

> 为了满足需求，供应商简化了包装流程，将所有植物放入一个统一尺寸的盒子中。

Let's say you're using just one box size to ship all of your plants.

> 假设你只用一个盒子大小来运输你所有的植物。

For smaller plants, there's more padding-填料,垫料 added to the box to fill the extra space, and the plants usually arrive intact-完好无损的.

> 对于较小的植物，会在盒子里添加更多的填充物来填充额外的空间，植物通常会完好无损地到达。

But larger plants have to be squeezed-挤压 into the boxes and sometimes arrive damaged, according to customer surveys.

> 但根据客户调查，更大的植物必须挤进盒子里，有时运到时已经损坏。

To fix this problem, you hypothesize-假设,假定 a potential solution by posing a question.

> 要解决这个问题，您可以通过提出一个问题来假设一个可能的解决方案。

Would more of the large plants have arrived intact if they were shipped in bigger boxes using the same padding we use for the small plants?

> 如果大型植物用和小型植物一样的填充物装在更大的箱子里运输，会不会有更多的大型植物完好无损?

Here is where your control comes in.

> 这就是你需要控制的地方。

You continue to ship half of the larger plants in the original boxes.

> 你继续用原来的箱子装运一半的大型植物。

This is your **control group**-对照组.

> 这是你的对照组。

And you experiment by shipping the other half in bigger boxes.

> 你的实验是把另一半装在更大的盒子里。

Nothing else is different about the boxes except the size.

> 除了尺寸不同，这些盒子没有什么不同。

The shape, thickness-厚度, box supplier, delivery addresses—absolutely everything else stays exactly the same.

> 形状、厚度、盒子供应商、送货地址——其他一切都保持原样。

After the larger plants are delivered, you conduct a new survey.

If more larger plants arrived intact, your hypothesis is confirmed.

> 如果更大的植物完好无损地到达，你的假设就被证实了。

If the results are the same as they were before the experiment, you'll need to try something else to solve the problem of your damaged plants.

> 如果实验结果和实验前一样，你就需要尝试其他方法来解决受损植物的问题。

Working in a controlled environment isn't the only way to ensure continuous improvements.

> 在受控环境中工作并不是确保持续改进的唯一途径。

There are various data-driven improvement frameworks, like DMAIC and PDCA.

> 有各种数据驱动的改进框架，如DMAIC和PDCA。

I'll define those and present them in the context of Plant Pals in the next video.

> 我将在下一个视频中定义它们并在Plant Pals的背景下展示它们。

See you there.



## Data-driven improvement frameworks

> 数据驱动的改进框架

In the last video, I introduced the concept of continuous improvements-改进,改善.

> 在上一个视频中，我介绍了持续改进的概念。

We explored in depth how working in a controlled environment can optimize your outcomes.

> 我们深入探讨了如何在受控环境中工作可以优化您的结果。

---

In this video, we're going to **keep on**-继续 that same path of uncovering-发掘,揭露,发现 methods for continuous improvements.

> 在这个视频中，我们将继续探索持续改进的方法。

---

We'll start with data-driven improvement frameworks.

Data-driven improvement frameworks are techniques used to make decisions based on actual data.

> 数据驱动的改进框架是用于根据实际数据做出决策的技术。

The first data-driven improvement framework we'll cover-包括,涉及 may be familiar to you since we discussed it in a previous course.

> 我们将介绍的第一个数据驱动的改进框架可能对您很熟悉，因为我们在以前的课程中讨论过它。

Recall-回想起that D-M-A-I-C, or DMAIC, stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control, and it maps out five steps that you can take when working toward continuous improvements.

> 回想一下，D-M-A-I-C，或DMAIC，代表定义、测量、分析、改进和控制，它描绘了您在朝着持续改进工作时可以采取的五个步骤。

When considering how you can improve customer experiences, start with the following: First, you'll need to define the business problem, goals, resources, project scope, and project timeline.

> 当考虑如何改善客户体验时，请从以下几点开始:首先，您需要定义业务问题、目标、资源、项目范围和项目时间表。

Next, measure.

Here, you'll conduct performance metrics and data collection to establish baselines and measure success.

> 在这里，您将执行性能度量和数据收集，以建立基线并衡量成功。

Then, analyze.

Work to find the root causes of problems and understand their impact.

> 努力找到问题的根源并了解其影响。

Next, improve.

This means implementing-贯彻,执行 a reasonable-有道理的,合情理的 solution to the problem.

> 这意味着要对问题实施一个合理的解决方案。

Lastly, control.

This is where you'll implement the changes and stay on top of monitoring the updated processes you've established.

> 在这里，您将实现更改，并监视已建立的更新流程。

---

Another framework you can refer to when working through continuous improvements is PDCA.

> 在进行持续改进时，您可以参考的另一个框架是PDCA。

PDCA is a four-step process that focuses on identifying a problem, fixing that issue, assessing whether the fix was successful, and fine-tuning-调整,微调 the final fix.

> PDCA是一个四步骤的过程，其重点是识别问题、修复问题、评估修复是否成功以及对最终修复进行微调。

The steps are as follows: First, plan.

Here, you'll identify the issue and root cause and brainstorm solutions to the problem.

Let's say that one type of plant isn't selling well, which means the warehouse-仓库 is full of a particular-特殊的,特定的 species-物种,种类.

> 假设一种植物卖得不好，这意味着仓库里装满了一种特定的植物。

If you don't do something fast, the plants may die soon.

What are some viable-切实可行的 solutions?

> 有哪些可行的解决方案?

You propose moving the items from the bottom of the sales page on the website to the top so those plants are front and center.

> 你建议将商品从网站销售页面的底部移到顶部，这样这些植物就在前面和中间了。

 You could also send out email marketing campaigns featuring-以…为特色 that plant, where you offer customers a buy one, get one offer on the plant.

> 你也可以发送电子邮件营销活动，以该植物为特色，在那里你为客户提供买一送一的植物优惠。

Second, do, or fix the problem.

In this case, your sponsor decided that they didn't feel comfortable-令人舒适的,感到舒服的 giving plants away if they could still profit-盈利.

> 在这种情况下，你的赞助商决定，如果他们仍然可以获利，他们就不愿意把植物送人。

You've decided to go with the first option: moving the plant to a more prominent-显眼的,突出的 part of the website.

> 你已经决定采用第一种选择：将植物移到网站的更突出的部分。

Your hypothesis is that the best way to shift older inventory-库存,清单 is to put it in a place that customers can't miss.

> 你的假设是，转移旧库存的最好方法是把它们放在顾客不会错过的地方。

The next part of this framework is check.

> 该框架的下一部分是检查。

Compare your results to the goal to find out if the problem is fixed.

> 将结果与目标进行比较，看看问题是否得到了解决。

Now you wait one week and notice if the sales numbers go up for that plant.

> 现在你等一个星期，看看植物的销售数字是否上升了。

If they did, your hypothesis is correct and you've saved some plant lives and helped Office Green avoid financial loss.

> 如果是这样，你的假设是正确的，你已经拯救了一些植物的生命，并帮助绿色办公室避免了经济损失。

Nice job!

Finally, act, or fine-tune the fix to ensure continuous improvement.

> 最后，采取行动或微调修复以确保持续改进。

In our example, you decide to reorganize-重新组织 the website.

> 在我们的示例中，您决定重新组织网站。

In the future, all overstocked-库存过剩 plants will get a prominent-显眼的,突出的  place on the website.

> 未来，所有库存过剩的植物都将在网站上占据显著位置。

---

Both PDCA and DMAIC are great problem-solving frameworks to apply in your day-to-day life and in the workplace.

> PDCA和DMAIC都是很好的解决问题的框架，适用于你的日常生活和工作场所。

These frameworks help you to identify issues, reduce errors, and optimize your processes.

> 这些框架可以帮助您识别问题、减少错误并优化流程。

I encourage you to think about these techniques next time you encounter-遭遇,经历 a problem or notice room for improvement within a workflow.

> 我鼓励您在下次遇到问题或注意到工作流中的改进空间时考虑这些技术。

You'll be surprised at how a simple framework can help set you up for success.

>  你会惊讶于一个简单的框架如何帮助你走向成功。

Awesome!

> 让人惊叹的，令人敬畏的

Now you know more about advocating-拥护,提倡 for and creating continuous improvements.

> 现在您对倡导和创造持续改进有了更多的了解。

We also defined and went through some examples of using frameworks DMAIC and PDCA for process improvements.

> 我们还定义了一些使用DMAIC和PDCA框架进行流程改进的示例。

Now that you know the basics of continuous improvement and process improvement, we'll discuss the differences between projects and programs and how they intersect-相交,交叉.

> 现在您已经了解了持续改进和过程改进的基础知识，我们将讨论项目和计划之间的区别以及它们是如何相交的。

I'll meet you in the next video.



## Differentiating-区别 projects from programs

> 区分项目和规划

By now, you know that a project manager interacts with their team members on a daily basis.

> 到目前为止，您知道项目经理每天都与他们的团队成员进行交互。

What you may not know is that project managers are also part of a bigger ecosystem-生态系统 within their business or organization. 

> 您可能不知道的是，项目经理也是其业务或组织中更大的生态系统的一部分。

Projects are not the only endeavor-努力,尽力 a project manager may participate in.

> 项目并不是项目经理可能参与的唯一工作。

There are also programs and portfolios-投资组合.

> 也有项目和投资组合。

A project is one single-focused endeavor, a program-规划,计划 is a collection of projects, and a portfolio is a collection of projects and programs across the whole organization.

> 一个项目是一个单一焦点的努力，一个规划是一个项目的集合，而一个投资组合是一个横跨整个组织的项目和规划的集合。

Think of it this way: projects can exist inside of programs, which can exist inside of portfolios.

> 这样想:项目可以存在于计划之中，而计划又可以存在于投资组合之中。

Note that I said "can" because this won't always be the case.

> 请注意，我之所以说“可以”，是因为情况并非总是如此。

Projects can also exist as separate, unrelated initiatives-措施,倡议.

> 项目也可以作为独立的、不相关的活动存在。

But if they're a part of something bigger within the organization, projects can become a program.

> 但是，如果它们是组织中更大事物的一部分，项目就可以成为一个计划。

The collective-集体的,共同的 and separate-单独的 successes of all of these three rely on continuous improvements.

> 这三者的共同和单独的成功都依赖于持续的改进。

So who are the people that manage these various endeavors-努力,尽力 and drive success?

> 那么，是谁在管理这些不同的努力并推动成功呢?

Let's think of this organizationally-在组织方面,组织结构上, starting with the project manager.

> 让我们从组织的角度来考虑这个问题，从项目经理开始。

A project manager oversees individual projects and has short-term, concrete-具体的,确实的 deliverables.

> 项目经理监督单个项目，并有短期的、具体的可交付成果。

The project manager is tasked with continuously improving their assigned project.

> 项目经理的任务是不断改进所分配的项目。

A program manager supervises-监督,指导 groups of projects, and even other project managers, and focuses on long-term business objectives.

> 规划经理监督项目组，甚至其他项目经理，并关注长期业务目标。

This program manager is tasked with continuously improving their assigned collection of projects.

> 这个项目经理的任务是持续改进他们分配的项目集合。

A portfolio manager supervises a grouping of projects and programs and provides centralized management to them.

> 项目组合经理监督一组项目和规划，并对它们进行集中管理。

This portfolio manager is tasked with continuously improving their assigned collection of projects and programs.

> 这个项目组合经理的任务是持续改进他们分配的项目和规划集合。

Different companies may have slightly-稍微,轻微地 different names for these roles, but the concept-概念,观念 is the same.

> 不同的公司对这些角色的名称可能略有不同，但概念是相同的。

Let's examine an instance where these roles directly create continuous improvement for their organizations.

> 让我们检查一个实例，其中这些角色直接为他们的组织创造持续改进。

A project manager has decided to offer monthly cross-departmental trainings to members of their team.

> 一个项目经理决定每月为团队成员提供跨部门培训。

Their team is small, so they figure it's helpful when people from other departments understand their workload and processes. 

> 他们的团队很小，所以他们认为让其他部门的人了解他们的工作量和流程是有帮助的。

This way, if someone is out-of-office, there will always be coverage-防守,覆盖范围,保险范围.

> 这样，如果有人不在办公室，总有保险。

After a couple months of these trainings, the project manager realizes they not only improve processes in communication, but they act as inadvertent-疏忽的,无意中做的 team-builders.

> 经过几个月的培训后，项目经理意识到他们不仅改善了沟通过程，而且无意中充当了团队建设者的角色。

Because of the trainings, employees have the opportunity to interact and to get to know one another better.

> 由于培训，员工有机会相互交流，更好地了解彼此。

The project manager takes this info to their program manager, and the program manager loves this unexpected insight.

> 项目经理把这个信息告诉他们的规划经理，而规划经理喜欢这个意想不到的见解。

Now, the program manager can establish these trainers across all of the projects that they're managing, making these continuous improvements program-wide, rather than just project-wide.

> 现在，项目经理可以在他们所管理的所有项目中建立这些培训师，在整个项目范围内，而不仅仅是在项目范围内，进行这些持续的改进。

So exactly what would projects, programs, and portfolios look like at Office Green?

> 那么，在Office Green中，项目、程序和投资组合究竟是什么样子呢?

Getting the Plant Pals service launched and running is a project.

> 启动和运行Plant Pals服务是一个项目。

It's short-term and temporary.

> 这是短期的，暂时的。

Once a service is launched successfully, the project ends.

> 一旦服务成功启动，项目就结束了。

Keeping the service going indefinitely requires the project to become a program.

> 要想让这项服务无限期地持续下去，就需要这个项目变成一个程序。

The program—running the Plant Pals service—becomes one of Office Green's long-term business objectives, and the company will work on continuously improving the program.

> 该项目——运行Plant Pals服务——成为Office Green的长期业务目标之一，公司将继续努力改进该项目。

Now Plant Pals, along with other projects and programs at Office Green, are included in the company's portfolio.

> 现在，Plant Pals和Office Green的其他项目和程序都被纳入了公司的投资组合。

As continuous improvements are executed-执行,实施 in Project Plant Pals, the program and portfolios and Office Green will notice the benefits of that.

> 随着“植物伙伴项目”的持续改进，项目、项目组合和“绿色办公室”将会注意到其中的好处。

For instance, let's refer to the example of overstocked-积压,库存过多 plants from the previous video.

> 例如，让我们参考前面视频中库存过剩的植物的例子。

Well, using PDCA—plan, do, check, act—you notice a drop in the sales of one of the plant varieties-多样化,种类.

> 嗯，使用pdca -计划，执行，检查，行动-你注意到一种植物品种的销量下降了。

So you decide to reorganize the website so the species that isn't selling is featured at the top, giving a small discount.

> 所以你决定重新组织网站，把不卖的物种放在最上面，给一个小折扣。

This change is so successful that you end up making it a best practice.

> 这种改变非常成功，最终使其成为最佳实践。

From now on, low-performing-表现不佳 and overstocked plant varieties will be featured at the top of the website.

> 从现在开始，表现不佳和库存过剩的植物品种将在网站的顶部显示。

This is, in fact, a new process.

> 事实上，这是一个新的过程。

Running it over and over again will drive continuous improvements.

> 一遍又一遍地运行它将推动持续的改进。

The continuous improvement you made to the project reflected well in your program and portfolio, because now that that it's been tested, the same strategy can be implemented company-wide for all of the company's other sites and products, reducing waste and increasing revenue across the board.

> 您对项目所做的持续改进很好地反映在您的计划和投资组合中，因为现在它已经经过了测试，相同的策略可以在公司所有其他站点和产品中实施，从而减少浪费并增加收入。

If many or all of the projects at Office Green see the same improvement, that directly benefits the program, which is the collective-集体的,共同的 of the projects.

> 如果 Office Green 的许多或所有项目都看到了同样的改善，这直接使项目受益，这是项目的集体。

If the same strategy is applied to programs at Office Green, the portfolio will directly benefit by having stronger indicators-标志,迹象 for profitability-盈利能力,利润率.

> 如果将相同的策略应用到 Office Green 的程序中，那么投资组合将通过拥有更强的盈利指标而直接受益。

Now we've learned how to define a program and how it differs from a project.

> 现在我们已经学习了如何定义程序以及它与项目的区别。

We've also discussed the impact of a project that could result in a program.

> 我们还讨论了一个项目可能产生的影响。

And we learned how a project can **turn into**-变成 programs or portfolios.

> 我们学习了如何将一个项目转变为项目或投资组合。

Now that you know more about how these three concepts work together, let's head to the next video.

> 现在您了解了更多关于这三个概念如何协同工作的信息，让我们进入下一个视频。



## Jacob: Cultivating-培养,开垦,耕作 a continuous improvement mindset-心态,观念模式,思维倾向

> 雅各布：培养持续改进的心态

I'm Jacob.

I'm a Product Operations Manager at Google.

> 我是谷歌的产品运营经理。

Product Operations is not that different from a program manager.

> 产品运营和项目经理并没有太大的不同。

I've had lots of different titles.

> 我有很多不同的头衔。

I've been a Solutions Consultant-顾问.

> 我做过解决方案顾问。

I've been a Program Manager.

Now I'm in Product Operations as a manager.

And really, it's the same set of skills: being able to organize people, take really complex ideas, make it simple for people to understand, so that our teams can then work on those.

> 实际上，这是一套相同的技能:能够组织人们，接受非常复杂的想法，使人们能够简单地理解，这样我们的团队就可以解决这些问题。

Products Operations Manager is a really diverse-不同的,各式各样的 role.

> 产品运营经理是一个非常多元化的角色。

Not only do we work with engineers, we work with the product, we work with legal, but we're really the voice of the customer. 

> 我们不仅与工程师合作，我们与产品合作，我们与法律合作，但我们真的是客户的声音。

And so we have a really unique position where we get to take customer feedback, whether that's coming in from a support channel, and then be able to kind of work with product to build a solution.

> 因此，我们有一个非常独特的位置，我们可以接受客户的反馈，无论是来自支持渠道，然后能够与产品合作，建立一个解决方案。

Process improvement is looking at data to understand how we can make something more effective or cost efficient-效率高的.

> 流程改进是通过查看数据来了解我们如何使某些事情更有效或成本更低。

When we work on projects, we're always taking a look at how we're managing things to see if we can be better.

> 当我们在做项目时，我们总是在审视我们是如何管理事情的，看看我们是否可以做得更好。

One example I can give is just taking notes—seems super simple, but a lot of times what will happen is notes get taken, and we forget to send it out again, we forget to send the email after so that people are updated.

> 我可以举一个例子，就是做笔记，看起来非常简单，但很多时候，我们做了笔记，然后忘记再次发送，我们忘记发送电子邮件，这样人们就能了解最新情况。

So we're constantly-经常地,不断地 looking at new ways to do things like take notes.

> 所以我们一直在寻找新的方法来做事情，比如做笔记。

How do we organize the skills and the projects that we have?

> 我们如何组织我们拥有的技能和项目?

So that's part of the process improvement is definitely-明确地,确定地 looking at the tools at our disposal-处理,清除 and seeing if there's something new. 

> 因此，这是过程改进的一部分，当然是查看我们可以使用的工具，看看是否有新的东西。

Continuous improvement's more a mentality-心态,思维方式 that we have on the team of constantly pushing ourselves-我们自己,我们亲自, even if we feel like the product is at a good place to be better.

> 持续改进更多的是我们团队不断推动自己的一种心态，即使我们觉得产品已经处于一个更好的位置。

Working with technology, things are constantly-经常地,不断地 changing, and so we have to have that mindset-心态 of continually trying to improve things.

> 与技术一起工作，事物是不断变化的，所以我们必须有不断尝试改进事物的心态。

You can plan things out perfectly, or what you think is perfect, and there's always going to be something to come up.

> 你可以把事情计划得很完美，或者你认为很完美，但总会有一些事情发生。

Once you get something out in the wild, people will use the product in ways that you didn't even think about, and so that's where that idea of continuous improvement comes in.

> 一旦你推出了一款产品，人们就会以你从未想过的方式使用它，所以这就是持续改进的概念。

Because even when you think it's great, you need to be able to look at it, let your ego-自尊,自我意识 down, and be able to solve those problems once you see how people are actually using it.

> 因为即使你认为它很好，你也需要能够看到它，放下你的自我，一旦你看到人们是如何使用它的，你就能够解决这些问题。

It's critical to technology because it moves so fast.

> 这对科技来说至关重要，因为它发展得太快了。

Things change so quickly.

If we aren't constantly improving the things that we do or looking at the processes that we have, we're going to get behind.

> 如果我们不不断改进我们所做的事情，或者不审视我们所拥有的流程，我们就会落后。

We're always adding new features, and so those always make new problems for us to try to solve.

> 我们总是在添加新功能，所以这些总是给我们带来新的问题，需要我们去解决。

If you believe that what you're trying to do is really for people, and you forget about the numbers, you forget about all of that stuff-东西, you remember that your product is going to potentially make someone really happy-快乐 or make someone potentially more successful in their business.

> 如果你相信你所做的一切都是为了人们，那么你就会忘记数字，忘记所有的东西，你只会记住你的产品会让一些人真正快乐，或者让一些人在他们的业务中更成功。

Those are the kinds of things that really make me excited to work and puts away all of that frustration-挫折,懊恼,沮丧 of the kind of lead up.

> 这些都是真正让我对工作感到兴奋的事情，把所有的挫折都抛在脑后。



# Using retrospectives-回顾的 for project success

> 为项目成功而进行回顾

## The purpose of a retrospective

> 回顾的目的

Have you ever-曾经,始终 looked back on an event in your life and wished it went differently?

> 当你回顾生命中的某件事时，你是否曾希望它能有所不同?

Well, we can't help you go back in time, but there are things you can do to ensure you don't experience the same missteps again. 

> 我们不能帮你回到过去，但你可以做一些事情来确保你不会再犯同样的错误。

In the last video, we discussed continuous improvements.

> 在上一个视频中，我们讨论了持续改进。

One way to ensure continuous improvements is to conduct a retrospective, so let's discuss that a little more in depth.

> 确保持续改进的一种方法是进行回顾，因此让我们更深入地讨论一下这个问题。

A retrospective is a workshop-研讨会 or meeting that gives project teams time to reflect-深思,反省 on a project.

> 回顾是给项目团队时间来反思项目的研讨会或会议。

Retrospectives, sometimes known as retros-倒退的, should happen throughout the life cycle of a project, but mostly are implemented after major milestones, or most commonly, after a project is completed.

> 回顾，有时被称为回溯，应该发生在项目的整个生命周期中，但大多数是在主要里程碑之后实现的，或者最常见的是在项目完成之后。

Retrospectives give you a chance-机会,可能性 to discuss successes and setbacks-挫折,阻碍 that took place within the project or phases.

> 回顾会议让你有机会讨论在项目或阶段中发生的成功和挫折。

You can think of them as a form of process improvement within your project.

> 您可以将它们视为项目中过程改进的一种形式。

Retrospectives serve-提供 three main purposes:

> 回顾会议有三个主要目的:

First, they encourage team building, because they allow team members to understand different perspectives within their team.

> 首先，他们鼓励团队建设，因为他们允许团队成员了解团队内部不同的观点。

Second, they facilitate-促进,推动 improved collaboration-合作,协作 on future projects.

> 其次，它们有助于改善未来项目的协作。

Third, they promote-促进,提倡 positive-乐观的,积极的 changes in future procedures and processes.

> 第三，它们促进了未来程序和流程的积极变化。

Let's detail each one.

---

Retrospectives are great for team-building since they enable teams to understand each other better and facilitate-促进,推动 better collaboration-合作,协作, which improves-提高…的价值 productivity.

> 回顾对团队建设非常有用，因为它使团队能够更好地理解彼此，促进更好的协作，从而提高生产力。

The emphasis-重要性,强调 in retrospectives is on continuous improvement and change, **instead of**-而不是 recycling old— and potentially bad—habits-习惯, procedures, and processes.

> 回顾的重点是持续的改进和改变，而不是重复使用旧的和潜在的坏习惯、程序和过程。

Retrospectives are helpful because even if we plan for every possible risk, odds are that something will sneak-潜行 up on us.

> 回顾是有帮助的，因为即使我们为每一个可能的风险都做了计划，还是有可能发生一些事情。

When something does **fall through the cracks**-被忽略,被遗漏 and you need to reflect-深思,反省 on it with the team, you may want to conduct a retrospective.

> 当有些事情被忽略了，你需要和团队一起反思时，你可能想要进行回顾。

Some additional reasons that you might want to conduct a retrospective include missed deadlines or expectations, or miscommunications between stakeholders.

> 您可能想要进行回顾的其他原因包括错过最后期限或期望，或涉众之间的沟通不周。

You may also want to hold a retrospective at the end of a sprint.

> 您可能还想在冲刺结束时举行回顾。

As a reminder, a sprint is a series of ordered tasks ending in a goal.

> 提醒一下，冲刺是一系列有序的任务，以一个目标结束。

You could also hold a retrospective after product launches and landings.

> 你也可以在产品发布和登陆后进行回顾。

These are all great opportunities to record key lessons that other people might learn from as they work on their own projects. 

> 这些都是记录关键经验教训的好机会，其他人可以从他们自己的项目中学习。

Identifying the **stumbling-障碍的 blocks**-**绊脚石** and successes in a project helps improve future processes, but the way you decide to conduct a retrospective can vary-不同,改变.

> 确定项目中的绊脚石和成功有助于改进未来的过程，但是您决定进行回顾的方式可能会有所不同。

There's no exact-确切的,精确的 formula-公式,计划,方案 or template for a productive-富有成效的 retrospective; the way you choose to structure your retrospective will depend on your team and workplace.

> 对于富有成效的回顾，没有确切的公式或模板;你选择组织回顾的方式取决于你的团队和工作场所。

You may decide to conduct a formal, **in-person**-亲自,当面 retrospective if your team prefers to debrief-汇报 in that setting.

> 如果你的团队更喜欢在这种情况下进行汇报，你可以决定进行一次正式的、面对面的回顾。

You can incorporate-结合,合成一体的 **sticky notes**-便利贴, documents, or any other kind of physical tools to help your team debrief.

> 你可以结合便利贴、文档或任何其他类型的物理工具来帮助你的团队汇报。

Or if you find that your team often gets **off track**-偏离轨道 during in-person meetings, you may decide a virtual or online retrospective is a better option.

> 或者，如果你发现你的团队经常在面对面的会议中偏离轨道，你可能会认为虚拟或在线回顾是一个更好的选择。

In this case, surveys might help to get thoughts organized.

> 在这种情况下，调查可能有助于理清思路。

Although there's no one way to conduct retrospectives, there are certain best practices to keep in mind.

> 虽然没有一种方法可以进行回顾，但有一些最佳实践需要记住。

As we previously mentioned, you'll want your retrospectives to be blameless-无可责备的,无过失的.

> 正如我们之前提到的，你会希望你的回顾是无可指责的。

Making sure that everyone feels comfortable-令人舒适的,感到舒服的 giving feedback as candidly-坦白地,率直地 as possible will result in the most productive-富有成效的 retrospective.

> 确保每个人都能尽可能坦率地给出反馈，这将促成最具成效的回顾。

To navigate-导航 through awkward-令人尴尬的,使人难堪的 situations or sensitive-敏感的,机密的 subjects, it may be necessary to encourage anonymous-匿名的 or private feedback. 

> 为了应对尴尬的情况或敏感的话题，可能有必要鼓励匿名或私人反馈。

A couple of tactics-策略,方法 a project manager can use to ensure the process remains blameless-无可责备的,无过失的 are changing perspective and switching from "you" language to "we" language.

> 项目经理可以使用一些策略来确保过程保持无可指责，比如改变视角，从“你”的语言切换到“我们”的语言。

Changing perspective-视角,观点 means putting yourself in someone else's shoes.

> 改变观点意味着要设身处地地为别人着想。

If your team is quick to blame-责备,归咎于 the delivery company for their plants not arriving at the customer's office on time, think about the situation from the delivery company's perspective.

> 如果你的团队急于把他们的植物没有按时送到客户办公室的责任归咎于快递公司，那么从快递公司的角度来考虑这个问题。

Was the delivery company's route-路线 optimized and tested to avoid traffic-交通?

> 快递公司的路线是否经过优化和测试以避开交通拥堵?

If not, maybe that should have been a task in your project.

> 如果没有，也许这应该是你项目中的一个任务。

Using "you" language can get you in trouble because it can feel like everyone in the room is judging-评判,判断 the person receiving the blame.

> 使用“你”的语言会让你陷入麻烦，因为它会让人觉得房间里的每个人都在评判接受指责的人。

For example, telling your project's sponsor that "You didn't make it clear that we didn't have money for a contingency-应急措施 budget when plants die" is not as productive-富有成效的 as saying "The lack of a contingency budget wasn't made fully clear from the get-go, and that's something that we can improve upon for next time."

> 例如，告诉你的项目发起人“你没有明确表示，当植物死亡时，我们没有钱做应急预算”，不如说“缺乏应急预算从一开始就没有完全明确，这是我们下次可以改进的地方。”

The project sponsor may feel attacked-攻击,侵害 and wonder-想知道 why you, the project manager, didn't ask the right questions in the early stages.

> 项目发起人可能会觉得受到了攻击，并想知道为什么你，项目经理，没有在早期阶段提出正确的问题。

Maybe the fact of the matter is that both of you could have done a little bit more to include a contingency budget, and that's okay.

> 也许事实是，你们俩本可以多做一点，包括应急预算，这没关系。

Make sure you aren't only focusing on the negative-消极的.

> 确保你不是只关注消极的一面。

Retrospectives are about reflecting on the positive aspects of projects too, so talk about what went well.

> 回顾也是关于反思项目的积极方面，所以要谈谈进展顺利的地方。

What was fun?

> 有趣的是什么?

What new things will you be able to carry with you into future projects?

> 在未来的项目中，你能带来哪些新东西?

Maybe the sales and marketing teams don't work together often, but this gave them an opportunity to bond-联系.

> 也许销售和营销团队不经常一起工作，但这给了他们一个建立联系的机会。

Maybe you enjoyed working with the Project Plant Pals contracted website designer so much that the team has decided to hire them full-time.

> 也许你很喜欢和Project Plant Pals签约网站设计师一起工作，以至于团队决定雇佣他们全职工作。

Whatever the positives were, they're worth celebrating.

> 无论积极的一面是什么，都值得庆祝。

You could even order some dinner or dessert-甜点 as a thank you to everyone.

> 你甚至可以点一些晚餐或甜点来感谢大家。

Finally, you'll want to make sure that you enact-制定,使发生 the changes you've discussed.

> 最后，您需要确保实施了前面讨论过的更改。

You'll put the discussed changes in place and decide to handle the project a little differently in the next phase.

> 您将把讨论过的更改落实到位，并决定在下一阶段以稍微不同的方式处理项目。

People don't want to participate in retrospectives if they feel their feedback isn't fully taken into consideration and implemented. 

> 如果人们觉得他们的反馈没有得到充分的考虑和实现，他们就不想参加回顾会议。

Now that you have a general overview for retrospectives, we'll build upon this foundation in the next video, where we'll demonstrate how to conduct your own retrospective.

> 现在您已经对回顾有了一个大致的了解，我们将在下一个视频中以此为基础，演示如何进行自己的回顾。

Meet you there.



## Conducting a retrospective

> 进行回顾

Welcome back.

Remember how I said there wasn't one exact formula or template to follow-遵循 when conducting retrospectives?

> 还记得我说过在进行回顾时没有一个精确的公式或模板可以遵循吗?

That's because every team learns, adapts, and grows differently.

> 这是因为每个团队学习、适应和成长的方式都不同。

In this video, we'll talk about how to conduct a retrospective.

> 在这个视频中，我们将讨论如何进行回顾。

---

Different situations call for different tactics-策略,手法, and when it comes to receiving potentially sensitive-敏感的,机密的 feedback, it's best to consider your team's needs.

> 不同的情况需要不同的策略，当涉及到接收可能敏感的反馈时，最好考虑你的团队的需求。

There are a couple of things to keep in mind before you begin a retrospective.

> 在你开始回顾之前，有几件事要记住。

First, you'll want to maintain a positive tone throughout the process.

> 首先，你要在整个过程中保持积极的态度。

Remember, even if there are some tough-艰难的 conversations, the objective of a retrospective is to encourage improvements, which prepare you for future projects.

> 请记住，即使有一些艰难的对话，回顾的目的是鼓励改进，为您将来的项目做好准备。

In general, the retrospective should be considered a positive experience where team members feel comfortable-令人舒适的,感到舒服的 sharing their feedback.

> 总的来说，回顾会议应该被认为是一种积极的体验，团队成员可以轻松地分享他们的反馈。

---

Next, you may need to be considerate of teams outside of your own.

> 接下来，你可能需要考虑你自己以外的团队。

If there are other teams you partner with regularly, they'll need to be involved in the retrospective, as well.

> 如果你有其他经常与你合作的团队，他们也需要参与回顾。

For instance, some adjacent-邻近的,毗连的 teams that were part of the project may feel like they want to voice an opinion-意见,看法 about the struggle to maintain communication between teams.

> 例如，一些作为项目一部分的相邻团队可能会觉得他们想要表达关于团队之间保持沟通的意见。

If they choose not to be involved in the retrospective, you'll at least want to share your findings with them.

> 如果他们选择不参加回顾，你至少会想和他们分享你的发现。

After all, smoothing-顺利的 cross-team interactions and deliverable-可交付 handoffs-交接 is a frequent topic of discussion in retrospectives.

> 毕竟，顺利的跨团队交互和可交付的交接是回顾会议中经常讨论的话题。

As previously mentioned, you can use various-各种各样的 props-小道具 and tools to conduct your retrospective.

> 如前所述，您可以使用各种道具和工具来进行回顾。

Here's an example of what a retrospective might entail-使必要,需要.

> 这里有一个回顾的例子。

As you'll notice, it's pretty extensive-广泛的 and includes a lot of opportunity for details.

> 正如你会注意到的，它非常广泛，包含了很多细节。

You'll want to encourage as much feedback as possible from your team.

> 你需要鼓励团队提供尽可能多的反馈。

This retrospective template is a standard document, with room for project managers to fill out and discuss with their teams and use it to guide the conversation.

> 这个回顾模板是一个标准文档，有空间供项目经理填写，并与他们的团队讨论，并使用它来指导对话。

**Go over**-复习,检查,回顾 the chain of events in the same way that they happened in real time.

> 用真实发生的方式来回顾事件链。

What happened during the planning stage?

> 在计划阶段发生了什么?

What could have gone better?

> 还有什么比这更好的呢?

Where did your team get lucky?

> 你们队在哪里走运?

How about during the execution stage?

> 在执行阶段呢?

As you do that, fill out the lessons learned section, which is a space for you to elaborate-详细说明 on things you could do differently the next time around.

> 当你这样做的时候，填写经验教训部分，这是一个空间，你可以详细说明你下次可以做得不同的地方。

This is a space to include which risks materialized-实现,成为现实 during your project.

> 这是一个空间，包括在您的项目中实现的风险。

Was there a large gap between the original plan and its execution?

> 最初的计划和执行之间是否有很大的差距?

How did the team feel about it?

> 团队对此有何感想?

Maybe several-几个,不同的,各自的 of your project team members commented-评论 on the fact that the website launch didn't meet the original deadline. 

> 也许你的几个项目团队成员评论了网站没有在最初的截止日期前发布的事实。

Because of this, sales team members didn't hit their numbers that month, the marketing department had to change the date on several-几个 pieces of content and ads-广告, and the sponsor had to answer to investors-投资者 who were eager-渴望的,渴求的 to view the website.

> 正因为如此，销售团队成员当月没有达到目标，营销部门不得不更改几条内容和广告的日期，赞助商不得不回应那些渴望浏览网站的投资者。

Team members are upset-不高兴的 now because if you had prioritized the website's completion-完成 and spent less time on less important tasks, this may have been avoided.

> 团队成员现在很不高兴，因为如果你把网站的完成放在首位，在不重要的任务上花更少的时间，这可能是可以避免的。

It's difficult feedback, but it's pertinent-切题的,相关的 for future successes to consider why this risk materialised.

> 这是很难得到的反馈，但考虑为什么会出现这种风险，对未来的成功是有帮助的。

Next time, you'll make sure to prioritize a task with so many dependencies.

> 下次，你要确保有这么多依赖项的任务的优先级。

Now that you've gone over how everything went, build a better future for your team by filling out the remaining-剩余的 tables.

> 现在您已经了解了所有事情的进展情况，通过填写剩下的表格来为您的团队创建一个更美好的未来。

The first one is action items and will address the question "What action should we take as a result of our lessons learned?"

> 第一个是行动项目，将解决“我们应该采取什么行动作为我们吸取教训的结果?”

You'll start on the left-hand side with the action items you want to address, then make your way through the cells to the right as you include information like: type—as in, is this a tool, a process, a team, or something else?

> 您将从左侧开始处理您想要处理的操作项，然后在右边的单元格中添加诸如此类的信息:键入，例如，这是一个工具，一个过程，一个团队，还是其他什么?

Owner—who will own this action item?

> 所有者——谁将拥有这个动作项?

And relative links—consider where we're tracking this item.

> 相对链接——考虑我们在哪里跟踪这个项目。

The next table is all about future considerations.

> 下一张表是关于未来的考虑。

Are there any risks that could become issues if not addressed in the next quarter?

> 如果下个季度不解决，是否存在可能成为问题的风险?

Do you need to pass off ownership-所有权 of this project to someone else?

> 你需要把这个项目的所有权转让给别人吗?

Include those and make sure to fill out the other cells, including: Type—is this a process, a team, or something else?

> 包括这些，并确保填写其他单元格，包括:类型-这是一个过程，一个团队，还是其他什么?

Contact—who can be a resource on this procedure-手续,步骤 if we need to reference it later?

> 联系人-如果我们以后需要引用该程序，谁可以作为该程序的资源?

And again, any links that may seem relevant to this topic.

> 再一次，任何看起来与这个主题相关的链接。

that could be relevant documentation if you're passing the project off or maybe a risk register-登记 from your project.

> 这可能是相关的文档，如果你正在通过项目，或者可能是项目的风险记录。

And there you have it.

> 结果出来了。

Now, I showed you a pretty standard retrospective as you'd fill it out, but if you feel like your team needs something a little more interactive-互动的,交互式的, feel free to have fun with it.

> 现在，我给你们展示了一个非常标准的回顾，你们需要填写它，但如果你觉得你的团队需要一些更互动的东西，请随意使用它。

The way you gather this information from your team can be more innovative-革新的,新颖的 than just a list.

> 从团队中收集这些信息的方式可以比简单的列表更具创新性。

You can use color coding, sticky notes, columns with emojis, and anything else you feel will suit your team and keep them engaged.

> 你可以使用颜色编码、便利贴、带有表情符号的栏目，以及任何你认为适合你的团队并让他们保持参与的东西。

Whatever you do, make sure you carry the lessons learned into your next projects.

> 无论你做什么，确保你把学到的经验带到你的下一个项目中。

In the next video, we'll recap all of our own lessons learned from this module.

Meet you there!



## Gernot: Using retrospectives to get back on track

> Gernot：通过回顾来回到正轨

My name is Gernot, and I'm a senior program manager here at Google, New York.

> 我叫Gernot，是b谷歌纽约公司的高级项目经理。

I work for a department called GEO, which is responsible for Google Maps and our maps products on Google Search.

> 我在GEO部门工作，负责谷歌地图和谷歌搜索上的地图产品。

A senior program manager is typically responsible for a set of projects and initiatives-计划,倡议,主动性 all the way from the ideation-构思过程,构思能力 stage, all the way through to getting them launched and landed.

> 高级项目经理通常负责一系列项目和计划，从构思阶段一直到启动和落地。

Something that happens to any project manager on pretty much almost on a daily basis is that there's something unforeseen that happens, and projects go off track.

> 对于任何项目经理来说，几乎每天都会发生一些不可预见的事情，项目偏离了轨道。

Retrospectives are a really important tool in the toolbox that every project manager should have.

> 回顾是每个项目经理都应该拥有的工具箱中非常重要的工具。

Often people say at the end of a project, "Okay, now it's time to do a retrospective," and you're sort of carefully looking at what are the things that happened that went well and that didn't go well, and what are some of the learnings that you can apply to future projects.

> 通常人们会在项目结束时说:“好了，现在是时候回顾一下了。”你会仔细看看哪些事情进展顺利，哪些不顺利，以及你可以在未来的项目中吸取哪些教训。

But I really think of this more as a continuous exercise along the way.

> 但我真的认为这更像是一个持续的练习。

Like, you really should be continuously checking in on how is the project going.

> 比如，你真的应该不断地检查项目进展情况。

One example of where a retrospective has helped us get back on track is, we were working on the project, where we are launching something on Google Search.

> 回顾帮助我们回到正轨的一个例子是，我们正在做一个项目，我们在谷歌搜索上发布了一些东西。

Halfway along the way, we realized there's actually a better way to do this that would realize-了解,意识到 much bigger benefits to our users. 

> 在中途，我们意识到实际上有一种更好的方法可以做到这一点，这将为我们的用户带来更大的好处。

As a result of that, we really got the whole project team together, and we really sort of talked through, what have we done so far? 

> 因此，我们真的把整个项目团队召集在一起，我们真的讨论了一下，到目前为止我们做了什么?

What is it that the current state of the project is?

> 项目的当前状态是什么?

What are our options to go forward to help us address some of the shortcomings-缺点,短处 that we have not identified?

> 我们有什么选择来帮助我们解决一些我们还没有发现的缺点?

And then collectively-集体地,共同地 replan the rest of the project to make sure we're sort of in a clear path forward and we have a clear understanding of how to get to that new understanding of adjusted success.

> 然后集体重新规划项目的其余部分，以确保我们走在一条清晰的前进道路上，我们清楚地了解如何获得对调整后成功的新理解。

It's incredibly-难以置信地,非常地 important to be flexible-灵活的 and adjust direction if needed.

> 如果需要的话，灵活调整方向是非常重要的。

Like, if you know that there's a change that's needed and you know that the project is going in a bad direction, continuing in that bad direction, obviously-显然,显而易见, is the worst-最糟的 thing you could do for the project and for the company.

> 比如，如果你知道需要做出改变，你知道项目正朝着一个糟糕的方向发展，那么继续朝着这个糟糕的方向发展，显然对项目和公司来说是最糟糕的事情。

It's really important to, as quickly as possible, initiate-开始实施,发起 that process of analyzing, what are the options in terms of things that we can do to course correct-纠正 and make sure the project is off in a good direction and embark-着手,开始 on that new direction as quickly as possible.

> 非常重要的是，尽快启动分析过程，我们可以做哪些事情来纠正错误，确保项目朝着一个好的方向发展，并尽快走上新的方向。

Obviously, while taking enough time to make sure it's a data-driven decision—all the stakeholders and sponsors are on board. 

> 显然，在花足够的时间来确保这是一个数据驱动的决策的同时，所有的利益相关者和赞助商都参与其中。

The most important things to keep track of as a project manager really depend a little bit on the project that you're involved-参加,加入 in. 

> 作为一个项目经理，最重要的事情是要跟踪，这在一定程度上取决于你所参与的项目。

So really I think tightly-紧紧地,牢固地 managing the scope, tightly managing the resources, tightly managing against-反对 the timeline that you set out, and really carefully assessing how things are going as you compare them to the plan that you laid out originally, and then use it to make **course corrections**-策略调整 as needed based on the things that you see.

> 所以我认为严格管理范围，严格管理资源，严格管理你设定的时间线，仔细评估事情的进展情况，将它们与你最初制定的计划进行比较，然后根据你所看到的情况，根据需要进行航向修正。
