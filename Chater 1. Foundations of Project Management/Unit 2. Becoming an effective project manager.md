It will also help you identify new skills that you may need to learn in preparation for your new career. Ready? Let's get started.

> 欢迎回来。让我们先回顾一下目前为止讨论过的内容。早些时候，你被介绍到项目管理作为职业道路。我们讨论了这门课程如何帮助你通过项目管理认证来推进你的职业目标。我们还讨论了项目管理的一些基础知识，比如如何定义项目及其不同的组件。然后，我们讨论了一些不同的项目管理职业、角色和责任。现在是时候深入了解项目经理的角色了。在本模块结束时，您将能够解释项目经理为其团队带来的独特价值。你还可以描述项目经理的角色和职责，并列出他们的核心技能。本课程将帮助你继续认识你已经拥有的技能，这些技能将帮助你成为一名成功的项目经理。它还可以帮助你发现你可能需要学习的新技能，为你的新职业做准备。准备好了吗？让我们开始吧。

## The value of a project manager

Earlier in this course, we introduced you to the world of project management. We discussed how project management spans-贯穿 industries-行业 and companies of all kinds, from large corporations-公司 to small businesses-企业. Now let's define what a project manager is and describe how they add value to their teams and organizations. 

> 在本课程的早些时候，我们向您介绍了项目管理的世界。我们讨论了项目管理如何跨越各种行业和公司，从大公司到小企业。现在让我们定义一下什么是项目经理，并描述一下他们是如何为团队和组织增加价值的。

Let's start with the definition-定义. Project managers shepherd-带领,引领 projects from start to finish and serve as guides for their team, using their impeccable-无瑕疵的 organizational-组织的 and interpersonal-人际关系的,人际的 skills every step of the way. As you learned earlier, project managers usually follow a process that involves-牵涉,包含 planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling costs **so that**-所以,以便 the project can be completed within the approved-认可的,批准 timeframe-时间表. We'll dig-搜寻,寻找 deeper into these topics throughout this program. What you need to know right now is that project managers play a crucial-至关重要的,决定性的 role in their organizations. Project managers add value to their teams and organizations in key ways that include prioritization-优先次序, delegation-授权,委派, and effective-有效的 communication. 

> 让我们从定义开始。项目经理从头到尾管理项目，并作为团队的向导，在每一步都运用他们无可挑剔的组织和人际关系技巧。正如您前面所了解的，项目经理通常遵循一个过程，包括计划和组织、管理任务、预算和控制成本，以便项目能够在批准的时间框架内完成。我们将在整个节目中深入探讨这些话题。您现在需要知道的是，项目经理在他们的组织中扮演着至关重要的角色。项目经理通过关键的方式为他们的团队和组织增加价值，包括优先级、授权和有效的沟通。

So let's **break these down**-把这些进行分解.

> 我们来分析一下。

---

First, we'll discuss prioritization-优先级. 

> 首先，我们将讨论优先级。

Project managers add value to their teams and organizations through effective prioritization of tasks required to complete a project. 

> 项目经理通过有效地安排完成项目所需任务的优先级，为他们的团队和组织增加价值。

They're experts-专家 at helping team members identify and break down large tasks into smaller steps. 

> 他们是帮助团队成员识别并将大任务分解成小步骤的专家。

There'll be times when a project manager may not know which task to prioritize. 

> 有时候，项目经理可能不知道该优先处理哪个任务。

To determine which ones are the most critical-严重的,关键的 to the success of the project, they'll connect with their teams and with stakeholders to gather-收集 information and make a plan. 

> 为了确定哪些是对项目成功最关键的，他们将与他们的团队和利益相关者联系，收集信息并制定计划。

Stakeholders are people who are interested-利益相关的 in and affected by the project's completion and success, like the leader of an organization.

> 利益相关者是对项目的完成和成功感兴趣并受其影响的人，就像组织的领导者一样。

You've probably used prioritization to complete work in the past. 

> 在过去，你可能已经使用了优先级来完成工作。

In any kind of project, personal or professional, there are tasks with different levels of priority. 

> 在任何类型的项目中，无论是个人的还是专业的，都有不同优先级的任务。

For example, let's imagine that you've decided to rent-租用,租借 a house and plan to repaint-重新粉刷 the rooms.

> 例如，让我们想象一下，你决定租一所房子，并计划重新粉刷房间。

You've picked-挑选,采摘 out your paint-油漆,涂料 and you're eager-渴望的,渴求的 to get started. 

> 你已经选好了你的颜料，你渴望开始。

While it may be tempting-引诱 to start painting-粉刷 right away, you'll need to prioritize tasks like laying-布置 out drop cloths to protect-保护 the floors and furniture-家具, applying blue tape-胶带 to the rooms' edges-边缘, and much more. 

> 虽然马上开始粉刷可能很诱人，但你需要优先考虑一些任务，比如铺好防水布来保护地板和家具，在房间边缘贴上蓝色胶带，等等。

Those preliminary-初步的 steps are critical-极其重要的 and need to come before painting. 

> 这些初步步骤是至关重要的，需要在绘画之前。

Other related steps, like choosing new **face plates**-面板 for your light-灯 switches-开关, can come later in the process or be switched out of the project entirely-完全地 if you run out of time or money. 

> 其他相关的步骤，比如为你的电灯开关选择新的面板，可以在稍后的过程中进行，或者如果你没有时间或金钱，可以完全退出这个项目。

When you choose to **take care of**-照顾,照料 these preliminary-初步的 steps before wedging-楔入 open the **paint can**-油漆罐, you're prioritizing the tasks or steps of your project. 

> 当你选择在打开油漆罐之前处理好这些初步步骤时，你就是在对项目的任务或步骤进行优先排序。

You're also increasing the likelihood-可能,可能性 that you'll be satisfied-满意的,满足的 with your newly-painted rooms. 

> 你也增加了你对新粉刷的房间感到满意的可能性。

This process is similar for professional projects.

> 这个过程与专业项目类似。

When you effectively prioritize important tasks, you set up your team and yourself for a better project outcome-结果,效果.

> 当你有效地对重要任务进行优先排序时，你就能让你的团队和你自己获得更好的项目成果。

---

Now, let's discuss delegation-委托,授权. 

> 现在，我们来讨论委托。

Project managers use delegation to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work. 

> 项目经理通过将任务分配给最能完成工作的个人，来为团队和组织增加价值。

Let's return to our house painting example for a second here. 

> 让我们暂时回到粉刷房子的例子。

Painting multiple rooms can be a time-consuming-耗时的 project, so it's possible that you might enlist-争取 a few friends to help you get it done. 

> 粉刷多个房间可能是一项耗时的工程，所以你可能会找几个朋友来帮你完成。

Maybe one friend has professional painting experience. 

> 也许有一个朋友有专业的粉刷经验。

Now, with that in mind, you might ask her to handle the more challenging-挑战 aspects-方面 of the project, like painting the ceiling-天花板 or the detailed-详细的 molding-模具. 

> 现在，考虑到这一点，你可以让她处理项目中更具挑战性的方面，比如粉刷天花板或详细的模具。

You might also schedule-安排 her to paint the molding before another friend paints the walls. 

> 你也可以安排她在另一个朋友粉刷墙壁之前粉刷模具。

So by delegating this task to the person with the right skills to complete the work and ordering the task appropriately-适当地,恰当地, you're applying knowledge of your team's strengths-优势,长处 to the planning of your project. 

>因此，通过将这项任务委派给具有合适技能的人来完成这项工作，并对任务进行适当的排序，您可以将团队优势的知识应用到项目规划中。

That makes sense-道理, right?

> 这很有道理，对么？

---

Finally, let's talk about effective communication. 

> 最后，让我们谈谈有效的沟通。

Project managers deliver-交付 value through effective communication, both with their team and with key stakeholders. 

> 项目经理通过与他们的团队和关键利益相关者的有效沟通来交付价值。

This **refers to**-指的是 being transparent-透明的, which means being up front with plans and ideas and making information readily-轻而易举地,迅速地 available. 

> 这指的是透明，这意味着在计划和想法的前面，使信息随时可用。

Project managers keep in regular-频繁的 contact-联系 with their team about the progress-进展 of the work and help identify areas-领域 where a teammate-队友 may need support. 

> 项目经理与他们的团队保持定期联系，了解工作的进展，并帮助确定团队成员可能需要支持的领域。

In our house painting example, this might involve-牵涉,涉及 checking in with your friends periodically-定期地 to ask if they have enough paint or supplies-物资 left to complete their tasks. 

> 在我们粉刷房子的例子中，这可能涉及到定期与你的朋友联系，询问他们是否有足够的油漆或用品来完成他们的任务。

Checking in regularly-定期地 means you'll know if you need to buy more paint before the can-罐子 is empty, which ensures that the project stays-维持, on track-轨道. 

> 定期检查意味着你会知道你是否需要在罐子空之前买更多的油漆，这可以确保项目保持在正轨上。

**In addition to**-除了 keeping up with teammates, project managers keep in regular-频繁的 contact with people outside of the team, like company leaders who are invested-投资 in the project outcomes. 

> 除了与团队成员保持联系外，项目经理还与团队以外的人保持定期联系，比如对项目成果有兴趣的公司领导。

For example, you might **reach out**-主动联系 to your landlord-房东,老板 to get permission to paint and to share the days you'll be working on this project. 

> 例如，你可以联系你的房东，获得油漆的许可，并分享你将在这个项目上工作的日子。

Though-虽然 your landlord isn't directly involved-涉及 in the project's execution, the outcomes will affect-影响 her property-财产,地产 and so it's important to keep her informed-了解. 

> 虽然你的房东不直接参与项目的执行，但结果会影响到她的财产，所以让她知道是很重要的。

Without-没有 your project management skills, you might **run out of**-用完,耗尽 paint halfway through the project, your walls might get painted without drop cloths-布料 to protect the floors, and your landlord could be **caught off guard**-措手不及 about your plans. 

> 如果没有你的项目管理技能，你可能会在项目进行到一半的时候用光油漆，你的墙壁可能会在没有掉落布保护地板的情况下被粉刷，你的房东可能会对你的计划措手不及。

So it's a good thing you're here to keep the project running smoothly-平稳地 and efficiently-高效地. 

> 所以你在这里保持项目顺利高效地运行是件好事。

---

Great.

> 很好地,很棒地

Now you should be able to define what a project manager is and explain-解释,说明 how they use prioritization, delegation, and effective communication to deliver value to their organizations. 

> 现在您应该能够定义什么是项目经理，并解释他们如何使用优先级、授权和有效的沟通来为他们的组织交付价值。

**Coming up**-即将到来, you'll hear about the career path of a real life project manager at Google. Their journey to me is fascinating-深深吸引,迷住 and we can't wait to share it with you.

> 接下来，你将听到现实生活中谷歌项目经理的职业道路。他们的旅程对我来说是迷人的，我们迫不及待地想和你分享。

![](img/6.png)

The team is a project’s biggest asset. A successful project manager knows that and takes the time to understand each person’s motivations, strengths, and weaknesses. Project managers add value to the project by identifying the right team for the project and enabling the team to be successful and make decisions. 

When you work to build a great team, you have to consider the skills needed for the project, as well as the resources available. Understanding the customer’s requirements helps shape the skills needed for your team. If you are working on a project that requires people with medical expertise and you hire people who do not have a medical background, no matter how hard that team works, they will not have the right skill set to complete the project. As project manager, you should bring on people with the right skills and ensure the team knows that each individual is valued, trusted, and appreciated. You can demonstrate how you feel about the team’s value by allowing them to have input and ask questions, and by addressing their needs as soon as possible. 

![](img/7.png)

Maintaining customer satisfaction and building a great team are two ways that you, as a project manager, can add value to a project. Both of these skills are built on the foundation of relationships and communication. The project managers who add the most value are the ones who take the time to build relationships, communicate, and treat others with consideration and respect.

Project managers can set the tone for a project and build relationships within their teams and with stakeholders. Taking the time to check in daily with your team, see how they’re doing, and ask if there is anything they need help with can go a long way towards making them feel valued and heard. 



![](img/8.png)

When you build teams, each person is generally assigned specific project tasks. Once each task is done, the person responsible for that task hands that part of the project over to the next person. Your team members don’t always see the whole picture and how they impact others in a project. A successful project manager sees the impacts of each process within the project and communicates those impacts to the team. This ensures that everyone working on the project understands their task goal as well as the big picture goal for the finished product. For example, if a graphic designer working on marketing materials for your project doesn't understand the customer’s overall goal to appeal to educators, they may not be able to fully capture the vision for the campaign. Helping this team member understand the big picture allows them to tailor their tasks to meet the needs of the project end goal.

Managing a project can be busy, but if you take the time to build relationships and maintain open lines of communication, you will increase the chances of the project’s success as well as the customer’s and your team members’ satisfaction. 

![10](img/9.png)

Sometimes, when you ask why something is being done a certain way, the response you get is, “Because we’ve always done it this way.” A project manager adds value to a project when they break down barriers, allow their team to innovate new ways to do things, and empower them to share ideas. As a project manager, you have to model ingenuity and collaboration, and encourage your team to do the same.

How can you break down barriers on a project? You can provide support for your team as they try new approaches to find solutions, and you can advocate for additional resources for your team. If your team is having a hard time getting an answer from another organization, you can reach out to the organization yourself in order to keep the team on track and on schedule. 

**Key takeaway**

You have now learned some of the ways that project managers can add value to projects and impact organizations. By focusing on the customer, building a great project team, fostering relationships and communication, managing the project, and breaking down barriers, you can overcome obstacles and find solutions to succeed. 





# Learning more about project manager roles and responsibilities

## Key project manager roles and responsibilities

Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed that last story because for me, it's always helpful to hear about someone else's career path. Maybe you even noticed a few parallels between their career path and your own, or you felt inspired to pursue a specific area of project management. So far we've discussed the types of project management roles you'll be qualified for, and how to search for them. Earlier, we discussed the value that project managers bring to their teams and their organizations. Now let's learn more about the roles and responsibilities of a project manager. Earlier you learned that project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome. How does that actually happen? That's where you come in. Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling costs, and other factors, so that the project can be completed within the approved budget and timeframe. Let's break these down into examples of responsibilities that you might find in a job listing for a project management role. We'll start with planning and organizing. One responsibility that falls under the umbrella of planning and organizing is making use of productivity tools and creating processes. During the planning and execution of a project, you might need to use certain tools and develop processes to improve information sharing across the team; you may also need to create plans, timelines, schedules, and other forms of documentation to track project completion, and you'll usually need to maintain those documents throughout the entirety of the project. The next task is budgeting and controlling costs, and other factors. As the project is underway, changes to the plan and budget are bound to come up. Believe me. This will require you to monitor and manage the budget, track issues and risks as they arise, and manage quality by mitigating those issues and risks. One way to do this is by removing unforeseen barriers that come up. Now, by barriers, we mean things that can get in the way of project progress. For example, if your teammates lack the resources needed to complete a task, you might identify that issue, or barrier upfront, escalate the issue to a stakeholder, and work to secure the resource so your team can move forward. Another huge piece of the project manager's role is managing tasks. A project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time by you, your team, or your stakeholders. Keeping track of tasks is a great way to help manage the team's workload and ensure that things are getting done. Keeping track of tasks is also a great tool for demonstrating progress to people outside the immediate team, like your stakeholders. Back when I was a program manager in Student Development here at Google, one of our goals was to create pathways for students who identify with communities that are underrepresented in the technology industry. A large part of my day-to-day responsibilities involved working with two separate engineering teams to create our technical curriculum. To manage the tasks associated with this project, I created separate project trackers for each team that outline the vision for the curriculum. These trackers kept both teams in the loop about the timeline for delivery, the categories and subcategories for work, and the team members assigned to each task, I also made sure to update our stakeholders every step of the way. By actively managing tasks throughout the project lifecycle, I was able to keep tabs on everyone's work and efficiently inform stakeholders, which allowed us to achieve our project goal with minimal issues. Nice job. Now you should be able to describe the roles and responsibilities of a project manager. Coming up, we'll discuss a project manager's role within the extended team, including how to work alongside the people tasked with executing the project. Catch you in a bit.



## Responsibilities that utilize interpersonal skills

**What are the core job responsibilities of project managers?** Let’s recap what we learned in the previous video.

The project manager is responsible for planning, organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs, and other factors to help keep the project within budget and on time. 

What does that mean? Basically, as the project manager, you will be responsible for tracking the day-to-day details of the project, but you will also have an opportunity to step back and see the bigger picture of the overall project.

Depending on the project and organization, you may also have responsibilities that utilize your interpersonal skills. **Interpersonal skills** are the behaviors you use to interact with others, such as communication, active listening, and leadership.

Let's review these responsibilities.



![Graphic of project manager responsibilities:](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/kZ70EGixT7ae9BBosa-2Qw_ed45fc8ca4cd4c9c92591dd707e3dcd0_Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-11.26.04-AM.png?expiry=1689033600000&hmac=jjbtrXK2e-cKaP8aYa18nYEUWfUn0WmzZvkBEMv0s2Y)Teaching and mentoring, empowering the team, communicating, controlling change and building relationships

**Teaching and mentoring**

As a project manager, you can serve as a mentor to your team. When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration. Mentoring and teaching others the lessons that you, as a project manager, have learned allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience. Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.

**Building relationships** 

Relationships are everything! Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just as employees. Taking the time to build relationships with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important. Dedicate time to check in with people. Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. Ask about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest. When you foster these relationships, you are all more invested in the success of your project.

**Controlling change**

The American novelist Louis L’Amour wrote, “The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.” This applies to projects as well. Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of your stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts. As the project manager, you are responsible for protecting your team. 

**Empowering your team**

We all enjoy being heard and appreciated in our careers. Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills! One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems. Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project. Effective mentoring often leads to more empowered teams.

**Communicating status and concerns**

As a project manager, communication is everything. With effective communication, you can work together with your team to find solutions to challenges. The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.

**Key takeaway**

You have learned that project managers may be responsible for teaching and mentoring project team members, building relationships with the team and various stakeholders, controlling change and the impact to the project, empowering team members to make decisions, and communicating status and potential concerns. These interpersonal responsibilities can be just as important to the success of your projects as your more concrete responsibilities, like scheduling and budgeting.

As you continue through this course, you will learn more about how these project manager responsibilities are embedded into the different phases of a project. 



## A project manager’s role within a team

Hey and welcome back. Earlier you learned more about the responsibilities of a project manager. And while it might seem like a lot to keep track of, it's important to know that you, as the project manager won't need to do everything on your own. Let's discuss the role of the project manager and how that role relates to other roles within the project team. It's easier to hear the term manager and immediately think of your boss. But a project manager is not often the direct manager of the people working on a project team. Here, we're discussing the project manager as someone who manages the tasks of a project. But what does that really mean, right? Well, although you might have a few teammates working with you on a project, you're probably not their day-to-day boss. With the help of your team, you can get a lot more done together. Everyone on your team will have their own set of roles and responsibilities. And you'll come together to ensure that everyone is able to do their part to advance the project. Each person will be an expert on their portion of the project, but no one will be an expert on every aspect of the project, and honestly, neither will you. For instance, the graphic designer will focus on graphic design, but probably won't be an expert on copywriting. Similarly, you'll be an expert on project management, but may not be an expert on marketing. Here's another way to think about it. Imagine that you're organizing a camping trip. You might be the person in charge of planning the trip, but that doesn't mean you have to be a camping expert. Maybe you've never been camping before, but your partner grew up spending every summer by the campfire. In that case, you might assign them the task of picking out the right number and style of tents for your group. So, in this example, you are planning the trip by giving your partner the job of finding the right number of tents and the right size tents to make sure everyone is covered. You aren't doing the research or the task yourself, but you're making sure that things are getting done. It's similar in the workplace. As the project manager, you won't be an expert in every project role, and that's okay. As we said, your job isn't to be the expert on everything. Instead you're responsible for guiding your team and making sure that they have the support that they need in order to complete the project. So how does a project manager go about doing that? Let's discuss using a few more examples of the required responsibilities you might find in a job listing. First, you'll need to hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks. Managing tasks will help you hold your team members accountable by giving them ownership over specific pieces of the project. Second, you'll need to ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and be able to establish escalation paths. Now by escalation paths, I mean that you should know how you will communicate risks to the right people at the right time. Third, you'll need to understand and help teammates adopt the right workflows and project management styles. As the project manager, you'll likely have the best idea of which style is best for the work. It's your job to ensure that the team adheres to that style and the other systems in place. And fourth, you'll need to collaborate with other teams at the organization to meet the requirements based on project, scope, schedule, and budget. In other words, a project may affect not only your team, but other teams at an organization, as well as, say, the marketing or the finance team. So you'll need to work with those teams to ensure that everyone is happy with the project outcomes. You'll learn more about working with other stakeholders in a later course. Catch all that? Let's recap. You learned that a project manager isn't always the direct manager of each member of the project team. Rather, they're responsible for guiding those people and ensuring they have the support they need to complete the project. Now that you have a good sense of the way that a project manager fits into the project team, let's move a little bit ahead, where we'll discuss the types of skills that a project manager needs to succeed. Meet you there.



## Working with cross-functional teams

As a project manager, you will likely work with **cross-functional teams**. A cross-functional team includes team members who have different backgrounds, types of expertise, and job functions. Even though these team members have different skill sets, occupy different roles, and may even work in different departments, they are all working towards a common goal: the successful completion of your project. 

Sometimes the members of a cross-functional team are referred to as “T-shaped professionals.” They are skilled in how to collaborate and innovate with those in different job functions and across different departments, but they also contribute their own specific areas of expertise. Each member of a cross-functional team has their own unique perspective and experience, bringing different ideas and strategies to the project. 



![Picture of four icons representing clarify goals, recognize efforts, measure progress and get team members with right skill](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/gK_ON5v7TH-vzjeb-4x_eQ_b440f0f442de436d8131d340873a82bf_Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-6.38.09-PM.png?expiry=1689033600000&hmac=87C_hJlivlTqETlwKmU7ZN5xUOBW9xYVlQ51PEMkY6A)

Let’s explore each of these ideas in more detail.

**Clarify goals**

When working with cross-functional teams, it is important to ensure that each member of the team understands their role, how they support each other, and the common goals of the project. It is vital to set clear goals for the team and make sure that the team understands those goals. Be direct and concise, avoiding extraneous details and explanations. When communicating task or project goals, make sure you define key items, such as budget, deadlines, quality requirements, or important resources. Ensure your team members understand task and project goals by encouraging them to ask questions and clarify information. It will be up to you to continuously check in with your team to make sure they’re all moving towards their goals, staying on track, and completing quality work. Cross-functional teams may work in different departments, be in different physical locations, and have different leadership, but all team members work together with the project manager to support the current project. Your project may be competing against other priorities, so communicating clearly and often with your team—and vice versa—helps you identify any potential issues or concerns before they arise.

**Get team members with the right skills**

Making sure you have team members with the correct skill sets for each of the project functions is critical. If you are building an airplane and you’ve got five engineers but no mechanics, you are missing a key element of your cross-functional team. As the project manager, you must help ensure that your team has the right people with the right skill sets needed for the project to succeed. Later in this program, we will discuss some tools you can use to help you identify the skill sets needed to accomplish your project tasks.

**Measure progress**

Showing your team how much they have accomplished helps keep them motivated. Take the time to measure and communicate the project’s progress across the cross-functional team. This helps everyone see the full picture and recognize their impact on the project. You can measure progress in many ways, including meeting key milestones, completing project tasks, and meeting project goals on time and within budget. Regularly communicate with your team members to check on their progress. Ask them if they anticipate being finished on time. If not, ask how you can help them succeed. Keep track of the team’s progress throughout the project by documenting when tasks and goals are completed, and let your team members know if the project is on track or not. Make sure you communicate successes, delays, or issues, to the team so they know how the project is progressing. Keeping everyone informed is essential to the project’s success.

**Recognize efforts**

Sometimes, when you work with cross-functional teams, there are certain skills that get recognized more than others. A mechanic could get accolades for coming up with the solution to a problem within the project, while the finance member who sourced the funding might be forgotten. As a project manager, it is your job to make sure that each member of your cross-functional team recognizes the value of their efforts each step of the way. You have learned the importance of building relationships with stakeholders, and building relationships with your cross-functional team members is just as important. Learning what makes your team members feel supported, giving and taking feedback, and being mindful of each individual's background, personal identifiers, and work style can help mediate some of the differences among team members. 

**Key takeaway**

Being able to communicate clearly with team members, clarify the goals of the project, get team members with the right skills, measure team progress, and recognize team members’ efforts is an important part of your role as the project manager, and is key to your project’s success.



## Elita: A day in the life of a project manager

A great project manager is some funky combination of EMT, ninja, and jazz musician. An EMT who can show up on a scene that's full of chaos, figure out what needs to happen now, triage all of the things on site, and then develop a plan of action while also participating in that action. A ninja, because you have to be stealth about how you go about influencing other people. Overt action or pushing people too hard isn't necessarily received well. A jazz musician, particularly a jazz drummer, who keeps a steady beat as a lot of things are happening around you. On a team, you're going to be surrounded by a bunch of talented people. A trombone player, a bass player, a trumpet player, a pianist, and you, keeping the beat and making sure that everybody is working in time. I spend most of my days with my product and engineering counterparts talking a lot about strategy, updating status to key stakeholders, and trying to figure out what comes next for our product. Some things about my job never change from this day to my very first day. The fact that I communicate with a lot of people in a day, a lot of different types of people, from engineers to product managers to partnerships, to sales and marketing, all of that's the same. The biggest difference is the number of people that I communicate with, and the complexity of the topics I cover. The most important thing for you to keep in mind is staying organized. The more organized you are in your actions, the more organized your team is in their thinking and their actions. What I do to stay organized is lists, all day long. I have post-it notes, I have electronic lists, I have lists in e-mails, and those lists help me stay on top of what actions need to happen now, what actions need to happen next, and which I can put off for a few more days. I do use lists to help manage my time. I think one of the things my lists are most important for is making sure I know what needs to be done today. Then, once my list is made and I'm sure of what needs to be done today, I budget time for those things. A stand-up is a quick meeting, usually at the start of the day, but you can have them at any time. My stand-ups usually happened in the morning around 9:30 or 10:00 o'clock, depending on when the engineering team got in. They lasted for about 15 minutes so that we were clear on what had gotten done the day before and what was on the docket to get done today. Then we usually checked in again quickly around lunch to make sure that people were still on track or ran into any technical issues that might require a longer time to finish the task. I think the thing that makes me a great project manager is a bias to action and resilience. One of my favorite phrases, is pick it and stick it. In part because I think it's important to make a decision to get yourself unstuck, to follow through on that action, learn some things and decide to take a new action once you've learned something. The latter half of that is resilience. I'm resilient and my teams are resilient. If we've taken a bad action, we've learned that we can learn and change our mind with new information. I'm Elita, a Senior Engineering Program Manager at Google.



# Acquiring the core skills of a successful project manager

## The core skills of a project manager

Hey, and welcome back. Now that you've learned about the roles and responsibilities of a project manager, let's discuss the core skill sets that a project manager should bring to the role. While there are lots of different skills a project manager can bring to their role, there are four specific skill sets that we think can help a project manager be successful. Those are enabling decision-making, communicating and escalating, flexibility, and strong organizational skills. First, let's talk about enabling decision-making. The ability to enable decision-making on the team, or gathering decisions from the appropriate leader, is crucial to keep projects on task and achieve their goals. Lots of the day-to-day decisions within a project will likely fall to you and your teammates to discuss and agree on. You'll ensure that projects stay on schedule by gathering information from teammates and using those insights to help the team make informed decisions. You'll also make sure that those decisions are communicated to the necessary coworkers, whether that's the immediate team or company leaders. For example, you might provide relevant data or feedback to help your teammates make an informed decision between choice A and choice B. The second skill is communicating and escalating. As a project manager, you'll use your communication skills in just about everything you do. This might look like documenting plans, sending emails about the status of the project, or holding a meeting to escalate risks or issues to stakeholders. The third skill is flexibility. As a project manager, knowing how to be flexible when changes are needed is key. Plans definitively will change, even with careful upfront planning. For example, maybe the goals of your company change, or maybe a member of your team unexpectedly takes a new position at another company. A good project manager knows that unpredictable moments like these are almost always guaranteed. A quote we love here at Google is, "The only constant is change," and that's true. By staying cool under pressure, you'll be able to adjust while helping your team stay calm, too. Finally, a successful project manager needs strong organizational skills. As you learned earlier, the role of a project manager requires using a lot of different processes to keep the project on track. Having strong organizational skills means having the ability to organize these processes and the core elements of a project to ensure nothing gets lost or overlooked, which trust me, can and does happen. To prevent this, you might decide to track daily tasks in a spreadsheet or send frequent status updates or reminders. There are many ways to stay organized and hone your organizational skills, and we'll talk more about them throughout the program. To recap, decision-making, communicating and escalating, flexibility, and strong organizational skills are four core skill sets that are essential to successful project management. You can continue to build on these skills by becoming familiar with industry knowledge that applies to most project management roles. Knowledge of helpful tools and templates and familiarity with popular project management styles like Waterfall and Agile, can help you organize and document the project throughout its lifecycle. We'll learn about these throughout this program. Hopefully, you feel better equipped to explain the core skills a project manager should bring to the role. These skills really help enforce team morale and accountability for the tasks of a project. We'll discuss this coming up. See you soon.



## Key competencies: Flexibility and handling ambiguity

In the previous video, we discussed the four key competencies of a project manager: **enabling decision-making**, **communicating and escalating**, **strong organizational skills**, and **flexibility**. With time and practice, you will master these skills to help you become successful in a project management role. In this reading, we’ll dig deeper into why **flexibility** is essential for effective project management and how you can help your team deal with **ambiguity**. 

First, let’s review the other project management competencies you’ve learned about so far.

**Enabling decision-making**

You can help team members feel empowered from the start of your project by making the decision-making process collaborative. For example, state the goals of specific deliverables and elicit input from your team on how to achieve those goals. You may have an idea of how you would like certain tasks to be accomplished, but your team members may have more creative or efficient approaches. Empowering your team to express their opinions and make their own decisions allows you to focus on the overarching management tasks and prioritize them in order of importance. Additionally, when you allow team members to have a voice in decisions, it helps foster an environment of responsibility, accountability, and team closeness. 

**Communicating and escalating**

Project management requires clearly communicating project goals and expectations, team member roles and responsibilities, and constructive feedback. Knowing how to effectively communicate and when to escalate issues to management is key to keeping you, your team, and your organization on the path to success. When escalation is required, try to approach management with both the problem and the potential solution or suggestions. This will show that you’re taking initiative as a project manager. 

**Strong organizational skills**

If you demonstrate that it is important for you, as a leader, to stay organized through efficient tracking and communications, your team will follow suit. One way to do this is by utilizing the abundance of organizational tools available, such as:

- Planning and scheduling software (templates, workflows, calendars)
- Collaboration tools (email, collaboration software, dashboards)
- Documentation (files, plans, spreadsheets)
- Quality assurance tools (evaluations, productivity trackers, reports)

You may need to experiment with different organizational approaches to determine what works best for you and your team.

**Flexibility**

All project managers need the ability to adapt and overcome changes and challenges. Let’s further explore why flexibility is such a critical project management skill and discuss how it can help prepare your team for change, mitigate risks, and handle ambiguity. 

**Flexible planning**

Change is inevitable, and the more flexible you are as a project manager, the more successful you will be throughout your career. These flexible planning strategies can help you manage your project during times of unpredictability: 

- **Assess external constraints**. When planning your project, take external events into account, such as national holidays and team member vacations and sick leave. Leaving extra time in the schedule for these inevitable events up front can help minimize the impact to your project.
- **Plan for risks and challenges**. If you consider the risks that may occur, you may be able to find solutions for them in advance. For example, what if someone on your team gets sick or decides to quit? Are you able to replace them within the company? If not, can you hire an independent contractor? Come up with a list of people who may be able to join your team if one of your team members becomes unavailable. You can also assess risks by looking at historical data. Review your past projects and examine the challenges you faced. Then evaluate if similar challenges could occur in this project and prepare accordingly. We will discuss risk management at length later in this program.
- **Calculate “float” in your schedule**. Float, or slack, refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the project outcome. Identifying float in your schedule can help with resource management, scheduling, and keeping your project on track. You will learn more about calculating float in a later course, when we discuss creating a critical path for your project tasks.

**Handling ambiguity**

Ambiguity can be a big challenge in managing projects. Project managers often face ambiguity in goals, requirements, schedules, vision, or other areas related to the project. Your team will look to you to lead during times of ambiguity and change, and flexibility is especially important during these instances. Here are some different ways to help your team deal with ambiguity: 

- **Keep calm.** In uncertain times, handling ambiguity with grace and poise will help inspire the members of your team to do the same. 
- **Express empathy**. As a project manager, it is important to try to understand what your team is thinking and feeling, especially during times of ambiguity. Let your team members know that you care about the challenges they are facing and are there to support them.

- **Communicate what you know clearly**. Define the aspects of the project that are confirmed and will not change. This helps your team get a better sense of what to expect, regardless of any aspects of the project that are still unknown or changing.
- **Make decisions and stick to them**. Try not to second-guess your decisions in front of your team since this can lead to greater uncertainty. If you need to change course, clearly explain why you have chosen to do so to your team. 
- **Trust the expertise of your team**. Increase clarity by having everyone on your team discuss what they already know or believe to be true about components of your project, such as what is involved in specific tasks or resources needed, based on their areas of expertise. Then, discuss what you still don’t know and brainstorm ways to gather more information.

**Key takeaway**

As a project manager, having the flexibility and ability to handle ambiguity in a rapidly-changing business setting gives you an advantage. Mastering these competencies, along with enabling decision-making, effective communication skills, and strong organizational skills, will allow you to innovate and grow as a project manager and leader.



## Rachel: My journey to becoming a project manager

My name is Rachel, I'm a Senior Program Manager in Google, New York. Google hired me out of a bar in the East Village about 12 years ago. For about three years, a group of NY Ops and SRE, drank at my bar. Like everyone at the bar, they asked the bartender for advice. I gave them advice and helped them through a lot of problems, and I also became friends with them. I really admired them, they were incredibly smart and charming and really good drinkers, and tippers. Eventually, I wanted something different for my life. I've been standing behind a bar all night long, and there was an opportunity to apply for an admin role in their team. So, I joined Google in 2008. They hired me first as an Administrator for Site Reliability and Engineering Ops in New York City. After about two years, I transferred into Program Management. Google's hiring is a little more conventional now, but the skills that I polished while being a bartender informed my everyday work. A wise old bartender that I knew in the lower East side once told me that, "A bar was a room full of tables and chairs and some beer, and a meeting room was the same, a room full of tables and chairs. People come into a bar like they come into a meeting room wanting to leave feeling something else." As a program manager, my job was to help people through that experience, the aesthetic experience of meeting with each other, making decisions, and coming to conclusions together. Very similar to bartending and helping people have a better night. My role as a program manager started by someone taking a risk on me. My engineering partner picked me out of the admin pool because he knew that I could build a community with these engineers. When you work in a bar, you have to talk to anyone who comes into the bar. Anyone who walks through that door is your customer. You have to understand what they want, what they want to drink, whether they can continue drinking, whether they might be done drinking, all of these things. When you are working with a subject matter expert, an engineer, a product designer, a UX person, the same things apply. You have to be able to talk to any engineer on your team, any product manager you need to work with, and you have to understand their unique needs. Program Management isn't just about the process and the artifacts that you create, it's about how you relate to people. Understanding what you've learned in other parts of your life, whether it was in a bar or art school, these are the experiences that you bring into the job that make your work unique. Your skills, talking to people or de-escalating conflict or understanding what people need. This is what makes you a great program manager.



## Common myths about project managers

We have talked about the skills that project managers need to be successful in their role. Now, let’s debunk some of the common myths about what is needed to be an effective project manager. 

**Myth: You have to be an expert in the field and have a lot of technical knowledge about the project.** 

**Reality:** There are benefits to the project manager *not* having a lot of technical knowledge about a project. Rather than getting caught up in the technical details when communicating with management and stakeholders, the project manager can look at all of the different pieces that the cross-functional team is working on and assess how they each contribute to the success of the project. As a project manager, you bring on the right team members—with their differing areas of expertise—and trust them to be able to focus on the technical aspects of the project. Your job is to handle the communication, documentation, and organization necessary to get the project successfully to the finish line. 

**Scenario:** Jamar just landed his first project management job with a construction company. He’s been tasked with managing the construction of a new elementary school in his city. He isn’t expected to know how to do all of the technical skills, like engineering, construction, plumbing, and electrical; he hires the right people for the job. He communicates the needs, timelines, and expectations of the project to his team members and stakeholders and helps break down any barriers to completing the project on time. Jamar helps the engineers and construction workers communicate with one another to ensure that they are all on the same page regarding the requirements. He makes sure that the materials are in place as needed for the plumbers and electricians. 

**The bottom line:** Project managers hire the experts and help put all the pieces of the project together. Project managers don’t need to be experts in every field.  



![Image of a person looking at a computer screen with a checklist](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/cfzrfy0sRf-8638tLLX_3g_a29c1378bf824943b5d6c69470a9b8c0_Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-4.00.08-PM.png?expiry=1689033600000&hmac=EB1dfAlEOFoJXqMbolMriCBloCZCMtJwCQz_1V1nWEU)

**Myth: Only people with a lot of experience within an organization can manage projects successfully.** 

**Reality:** It is a common misconception that anyone who has significant experience and success in an organization can manage projects there. In order to successfully manage projects in any organization, you must acquire the necessary skills, knowledge, tools, and techniques and be able to apply them. You don’t necessarily need to have worked in previous roles at that organization. In taking this certification, you are learning and practicing how to be an effective project manager before taking on a position.

**Scenario:** Sofia is a supervisor at a large customer service call center. She has been recognized by leadership as a top performer. To reward her, management has offered her the role of project manager for the implementation of a new call center software program. It will be her job to oversee the installation, training, and implementation of the new process. Sofia tries to manage the project, but she has no idea how to create a project plan, manage the various members of her team, identify risks, or handle any of the other major project management tasks. She lets her manager know that she does not have the appropriate training to manage the project but that she would like to build those skills. Sofia’s manager enrolls her in a project management training course so that she will have the necessary skills to manage projects in the future. 

**The bottom line:** To be a successful project manager at any organization—regardless of whether you have worked there previously—it is essential to master the skills, tools, and techniques of project management.



![Image of a person with a long list of details](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/dB7M4WvPTk-ezOFrzw5PJQ_a6e6a41501e24d3cbce2e5451706138c_Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-3.59.10-PM.png?expiry=1689033600000&hmac=IphSdhSpESvFvCmr-hZL5lEXs2WzF45UVb-gt2S35Gs)

**Myth: You have to know every single detail about the project at all times.** 

**Reality:** Details matter in project execution, but as a project manager, you must also focus on the big picture and strategy for the project. What is the end goal? Do you and your team have a clear direction? If the whole team understands their objectives and has what they need to be successful in their tasks, they can work on the individual details and provide you space to supervise the overall project goals. Open lines of communication will help ensure that your team members share any possible risks to the budget or schedule with you. 

**Scenario:** Yui is a project manager working for a clothing company. The company is developing a new line of winter sleepwear that is set to launch in late October. Yui meets with the key stakeholders to determine their goals and timeline for the project. She recruits employees from the merchandising, exports, marketing, materials, production, and quality control departments to be a part of the project team. Yui meets with her team at the start of the project to clarify the objectives for the product line and checks in with them regularly to remove any barriers and find out where they need additional support. When a team member from the materials department informs Yui that the fabric they were planning on using for a particular style of pajamas has increased in price, Yui works with the team member to find a new supplier so that the overall project budget is not impacted. 

**The bottom line:** Your role as a project manager is to communicate with your stakeholders, clarify objectives, and set expectations. Trust your team to handle the details of each project task and communicate with you when there’s an issue. Through your direct communication and strategic approach to problem-solving, you can provide solutions and help remove barriers for your team. This is where you add value! 

We have just busted three project management myths! Recognizing these truths will help you be more confident and successful as you pursue your project manager career.



## Leadership and team dynamics

Earlier, you learned about the role of the project manager and the core skills you'll need to be successful in that role. You've also learned more about your role within the project team. Now let's discuss a few key skills that you'll use to build relationships with your teammates and stakeholders. Using your interpersonal skills is key to building relationships with the people involved in your project. By developing these relationships, you'll learn about the needs and concerns of the team. This will help you determine the priorities of the project and motivate your team throughout the process. Possessing strong interpersonal skills is a huge part of good leadership. Even if you've never held a formal leadership position, having these skills will help you when you need to guide a team. This is called influencing without authority, which refers to a project manager's ability to guide teammates to complete their assigned work without acting as their direct managers. There's a few key interpersonal skills that you can use to accomplish this and guide the project outcomes, even without the authority of being your teammates' boss. These skills include communication, negotiation, conflict mediation, and understanding motivations. Let's break these down. First step is a key skill we've mentioned a few times now, communication. In the context of leading a team, communication can include checking in with teammates to understand how they're progressing on a task and providing clear feedback on the quality of a teammate's work. Next is negotiation. Negotiation might include working with a teammate to compromise on a new deadline when they tell you that they won't be able to complete their work on time. Now, trust me, I know this can be frustrating, but you'll need to use your negotiation skills often with your teammates and stakeholders to balance their needs and what is best for the project. Another important skill is conflict mediation. As we mentioned, project plans can change and issues will arise. This can sometimes lead to tension and conflict within the team. Conflict mediation is a great skill to practice and develop to ensure the project does not suffer as a result. This might involve setting up a meeting with two teammates who are struggling to agree upon the best way to handle a shared task. Finally, there's understanding motivations. This means getting to know your teammates and figuring out what pushes them to do their best work. Understanding motivations might also include learning how your teammates prefer to receive feedback, and how they like to receive recognition for doing a great job. You would use that individualized information to motivate and encourage each person on your team. To recap, communication, negotiation, conflict mediation and understanding motivations are all interpersonal skills that will help you influence without authority. During job interviews for project management positions, you might be asked to discuss a time when you influenced without authority, and it's possible that you've already noticed ways that you've used these skills in your personal life without even realizing it. For example, let's say you have a coworker who's constantly late to every meeting and I mean, every meeting, while you can't force them to arrive on time, it's likely that you've thought about ways to motivate them to want to be on time. In doing so, you might have also wondered how to change the way you communicate with your coworker, to influence them to be on time. Maybe you've tried asking them to arrive 15 minutes earlier than the rest of the group or maybe you've told them how this behavior impacts the rest of the team. Both of these strategies are examples of influencing without authority, and they serve to encourage specific behavior. Influencing without authority is one of the most critical and one of the most challenging aspects of project management. As you've just learned, you'll need to leverage your interpersonal skills in order to do it effectively. In later courses, we'll review and learn more about using your interpersonal skills to manage various projects. We'll see you in the next video.



## Ellen: Traits of a successful project manager

I'm Ellen and I'm a director of technical program management. That means I lead a team of program managers at Google. I love project management because I really like this idea that you can do more together as a team with a group of people than you could do alone. By bringing in a bunch of people together and getting organized, getting aligned around a common goal, We can do some pretty amazing things. I think a successful project manager is somebody who really knows how to pull together a group of people. To me, there's really two parts of project management. One is this laser-like focus on executing on this goal, but then the other part is the people. So a successful project manager can do both. When I first started managing project managers, it was really about everyone works on their own project. How do I just guide them, give them guidance and help them with their projects. Over the years, I've shifted to mentoring on project management, to mentoring project managers. What I mean by that is, it's different. I'm no longer saying, "Here's what you should do on your project." I'm really trying to help them think about how to think about their projects. One of the things that I think about a lot as I'm building a project management team is having a really diverse set of folks with different backgrounds, different experiences. We're a global company, so we're really trying to make sure we are a global team as well. When I talk about diversity of background and experience, it really is about working in different types of environments with different types of teams. When I chat with new project managers and they say like, "How do I continue to grow as a project manager?" My answer is, work on different projects, work on as many projects as you can, but don't be afraid to try different areas, different domains, work with different people. With every project you work on, you're going to really learn something.
