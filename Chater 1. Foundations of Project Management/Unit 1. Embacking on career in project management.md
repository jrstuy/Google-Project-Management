Wondering-想知道 how I started my own career in project management? Well, in college-大学, I always gravitated-被吸引到 towards things that were more hands-on-动手的 and action-oriented-行动向导 and less theoretical-理论的. I wanted to make an impact-巨大影响 in whichever-无论哪个 career-职业 I took on. My first job out of college was as a Spanish-西班牙语 and leadership-领导力 teacher in Los Angeles, California. My main objective-目标,目的 in guiding the student leadership team at the school was to identify, mobilize-组织,调动, and inspire-激励,鼓励 the student leaders. After two years of teaching, I realized-意识到 that the moments-片刻 when I felt-觉得 the most energized-使活跃 were when I was building a vision-愿景 for how to get a big project done or when I was working to bring different groups together around a common goal. 

That's when I realized-认识到,意识到 I had a lot of core project management skills, and I could **focus on**-专注于 growing and developing them in the business world.

# Understanding the basics of project management

## What is project management?

Hey, again! Let's get back into it. 

In this video, we'll define-定义 a project, define-定义 project management, and explain its value to an organization. Let's start by defining exactly-精确地,确切地 what a project is. 

A project, is a unique endeavor-尽力,努力, and usually-通常地,经常地 includes a set of unique deliverables. It's also a temporary pursuit-追求. It has a defined-明确 beginning and an end. To put it another way, a project is a series of tasks that need to be completed to reach a desired-期望得到的 outcome-结果,效果. Reaching that desired-期望得到的 outcome takes collaboration-合作,协作 and careful planning that keeps the project on track and on budget. 

That's where project management comes in. -这就是项目管理的用武之地。

Project management is critical-关键的 to the success of projects both big and small. Let's break it down into the what, the why, and the how. 

What is project management? 

Why is project management an important part of an organization? 

How is it vital-至关重要的,必不可少的 to a project's success? 

As I mentioned-提到,谈到, project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired-期望得到的 outcome. Project management is valuable to businesses because it helps ensure that a project delivers the expected-预料的,预期的 outcomes, both on time and within budget. To demonstrate-证明 what I mean I'll take you through a real-life example of project management. 

Imagine a **school district**-学区 **signs a deal**-签订协议 with a telehealth-远程医疗 company to make sure students don't have to miss school for simple health issues, like fevers-发烧,发热 or headaches-头痛,头疼. The deal-交易 will be completed by the end of the school year. The students can now interact-相互交流 with the doctor through a tablet, smartphone-智能手机, or a computer, while they're at school. Implementing-执行,贯彻 this technology into the school's procedures-程序 is the project. It's got a clear outcome and start and end date. 

So, how is that project managed? 

Well, this project has several-几个,数个 tasks, and each one has to be carefully planned out and tracked, or managed, **in order for**-为了 the project to be completed. For example, to start you can organize training-培训,训练 sessions for faculty-全体教员 to get them better acquainted-使熟悉 with the technology, policies, and procedures-程序. You can budget for tablets, computers, and other vital-必不可少的 equipment-设备 to facilitate-使便利,促进,推动 the virtual-虚拟的 checkups-审查,检查. You can maintain-保持,维护 strong communication with doctors, the telehealth-远程医疗 company, and school **staff-全体员工 members**-工作人员 and so much more. To successfully launch-发动,发起 the product in the schools all of those things need to get done. 

That is project management. Seems pretty-相当,颇 important to an organization's success, right? 

More and more companies are starting to understand how project management can save-节省 them lots of money and time. Poor-劣质的 project management can lead to trillions-万亿 of wasted-浪费掉的 dollars every year for organizations around the world. More specifically, poor project management can lead to 48 percent-百分之 of projects missing delivery dates, 43 percent missing budget targets, and 31 percent failing-未能做到 to meet an organization's goals. 

As a company that serves so many different purposes-目的,目标 in communities-社区, it's no surprise that project management's a huge-庞大的,极大的 part of Google. 

But here, many of our project managers are described as "program managers," because they manage multiple projects for specific products, teams, or programs. There are thousands-数千 of people here with the job of keeping projects and programs running smoothly-平稳地. 

People like me. I'm a responsible-负责的 innovation革新,创新 program manager. My team is responsible for ensuring that the technology we produce, the research we pursue-追求,致力于, and the publications-出版物 we put out are all done with Google's artificial-人造的,人工的 intelligence-智力,才智 principles in mind. 

I review the processes for each of these types of technologies, and I give ideas for how to continue innovating-革新,改革 responsibly-认真负责地 to meet our organizational goals. 

My job adds value to Google through the core aspects-方面 of project management we've mentioned-提及,说起, planning and organizing, managing tasks, and budgeting and controlling costs. 

Hopefully you have a better sense-理解力 of what a project is, what project management is, and why project management is an important part of every company, and how it's vital to a project's success. 

Next up, we'll learn more about what a project manager does.



## What does a project manager do?

Hey, so we've covered what project management is and why it's important to organizations. Now, let's learn more about what project managers do on a **day-to-day basis**-日常. 

Project managers usually follow a process that involves-牵涉,涉及 planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs and other factors-因素,要素. Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and on budget. **In broad-广泛的 terms**-大体上, a project manager also needs to make sure that the project outcome is bringing value to the company. 

A project manager can add value in many different ways. Whether that's creating a new service for customers or modifying an old service so it's more tailored-特制的,专门的 to the customer's needs. **No matter**-无论如何 what the task is, a successful project will always add value. And it's the project manager's job to make sure that project is both valuable and successful. 

You may be asking yourself, well, if I'm a project manager, how do I add value to an organization every day? What does the day-to-day life of a project manager look like? Well, a project manager's responsibilities can vary-不同的,呈现差异, depending on the project, the industry-行业,领域, and the company they're working in. 

Are you constructing a new building? 

Are you project managing a renewable-可再生的 energy-能源 product in a startup-初创公司? 

Or are you setting up your own event-活动 management company? 

Your tasks will be different in each scenario, but here's a general-总体的 overview of what a typical-典型的,一贯的 day might look like.



A project manager's daily responsibilities always include some version of the following, planning and organizing. An example of that might be gathering-收集,采集 requirements from teammates or customers. This means **figuring out**-弄清楚,理解 what exactly-究竟,到底 your project's trying to accomplish. You might have a kickoff-开始 meeting or send a survey. From here you may also work on creating project plans. Creating project plans is a key part of project management. It helps set the tone-风格 of the project, keeps everyone on pace-速度,节奏 and aligned-使一致, and helps move tasks along-向前. 

Which leads me to my second point, managing tasks. Once-一旦 the project is underway-在进行中的, the project manager helps manage tasks for the team members and communicates-传达,传递 key milestones-里程碑 to the larger team or customers. This helps keep team members, and customers updated on how the project is progressing-进步,进展. 

The third piece-部分 is budgeting and controlling costs and other factors. Managing the budget and controlling costs is a common responsibility that project managers have to understand to keep the project on track-轨道 and within-在...范围内 budget. 

This is a **full-time**-专职的,全日制的 job because the plan you've created and managed may change causing unexpected costs to come up. And that's just to **name a few**-列举几个. I could go on for days. But the most important thing to know about the day to day of a project manager is this: 

You'll use different tools, techniques and methodologies every single day. There's never a dull-枯燥无聊的 moment. 

Personally-就个人而言, my favorite part about being a project manager is that I get to watch the project's growth from start to finish. 

It's really special to create something from nothing, working from the **ground up**-从零开始. 

It's a really satisfying-令人满意的,令人满足的 feeling. 

As a project manager, you'll use a variety of skills every day, and a lot of these skills you might already have, and we'll discuss this more coming up. 

See you there.



## Transferable project management skills

Welcome back. Let's get right into it 

and explore the variety of skills you'll use. 

Have you ever been tasked with 

planning a loved one's surprise birthday party? 

There's usually a lot of pressure 

and responsibility, but when you 

get it right, it feels amazing. 

That's still true even if there were a couple of issues. 

Maybe the guest of honor arrived 

home earlier than expected 

and nearly ruined the surprise. 

But if you made someone feel special 

on their birthday you 

probably planned a successful project. 

As you chose a venue, sent out invitations, 

and calculated your budget based on your number of guests, 

you were using several project management skills, 

like planning and organizing, managing tasks, 

budgeting, and controlling costs, and more. 

Or maybe you've never planned a party. 

Have you ever worked in the retail space, 

or in the service industry? 

Then you might have experience that'll 

translate into the project management field, too. 

For example, you might have been in 

charge of managing several employees' schedules. 

To do that, you had to plan 

and organize which employees' work styles 

would complement each other in a productive way. 

You also had to make sure that 

all duties and responsibilities 

would be covered during each shift. 

Plus, you had to be aware of all employees' availability. 

Doesn't sound familiar? 

Well, have you ever had to relocate for a new job 

and planned a big move? 

To successfully move all of your belongings, 

you may have coordinated friends and family to help. 

You would have had to budget 

and control costs for moving companies, 

boxes, and miscellaneous expenses. 

You probably packed your boxes one room at a time 

and clearly labeled the boxes 

so that you knew what each box was 

when you arrived at the new place. 

You had to manage all of these tasks simultaneously. 

You've likely handled several tasks 

like these in your lifetime. 

In studying project management, 

you'll learn to further advance 

and sharpen these skills 

so that you'll be equipped to manage even 

bigger, more daunting tasks. 

The abilities that helped you 

complete these past projects 

are a great selling point for 

yourself as a future project manager. 

So be sure to bring up these examples 

in job interviews to demonstrate your skills. 

For instance, if you're asked questions like, 

"Tell me about a time when you had 

to juggle several tasks at once", 

or "Tell me about a time when you 

had to influence a customer or a teammate." 

It's good to have examples that demonstrate 

your skills with time management 

and leadership in both your everyday life 

and previous workplaces. 

Are you thinking about all of 

the skills that you already have 

and can use in your future project management role? 

Perfect. Up next, we'll 

learn more about the types of project management roles 

that you'll be qualified for after this program. 

We'll also discuss how to start exploring 

the various job opportunities out 

there for you. See you soon.



## X: Path to becoming a project manager

Hey everyone, my name is X. 

Yes, just the letter. 

At Google, I'm a Program Manager for 

a department called Responsible Innovation. 

Most of us, in our everyday life, use program management. 

When you have only a couple hours 

left in a day and you have to figure out, 

well, do I clean my house or 

do I go to the grocery store? 

How long will each of those task takes? 

Those are just different elements or 

variations of program management and project management. 

My path to program management is pretty non-traditional. 

I didn't go graduate from a great college. 

In fact, I dropped out of 

high school and I dropped out of college. 

So a GED is the highest credential that I have. 

After I dropped out of high school, 

I taught myself how to code. 

I built a whole bunch of websites, 

but realized, like, I didn't have 

the responsible skills to make me a "mature adult." 

So I ended up joining the military. 

After spending eight years in the Army, 

I traveled the world building apps for 

really big companies and governments around the world. 

When I came into Google, 

I realized I could still be technical, 

but then I'm just using the skills I already have. 

So how can I grow myself as 

a person by learning new skills? 

That's when I heard about the program manager role. 

The program manager role at Google is super cool 

because it varies depending on which team you're on. 

If you're a program manager on Google Cloud, 

that could look very different than 

being a program manager in YouTube. 

That switch up and that change 

from coding all day long in front of a computer screen 

was something that was really, 

really attractive to me. 

Some of the biggest skills from my past and 

my history that helped me become 

a program manager and make that transition from somebody 

who was managed by program and project managers, 

to actually becoming one myself, 

was taking a little bit more 

accountability in my personal life. 

There's lots of things I want to learn in life. 

I started doing things like making schedules to 

practice, like, different instruments, 

like the bass guitar. 

Each of my roles, 

whenever I worked with a project or program manager, 

I also made sure to check in with them 

about why they were doing what they were doing. 

I'm someone who doesn't really learn from 

books if you can't tell by me dropping out of school. 

So I always found somebody who was willing to teach 

me why they were doing 

what they were doing, because that's how I learn. 

I tend to be more kinetic. 

I learn as I go. Program management 

to me was a natural calling. 

Not because I like to run around 

and tell everybody what to do, 

but because I have a real 

personal passion for bringing people 

together and getting everybody on 

the same page to move towards the same goal. 

Whether that's convincing all my friends to go to 

my favorite vegan spot in downtown LA, 

like four times a week, 

or whether that's getting us all together to resolve 

conflict or to work on 

an idea and collaborate on projects on the side together. 

Those skills that you use in 

your everyday life to keep your task 

together can apply to program and 

project management very easily. 

You just have to be a little bit more intentional 

around them and there's a lot more paperwork involved.













# Learning about careers in project management



## From certificate to career success

Welcome back. Now that you have 

a general understanding of what a project manager does, 

let's focus on the types of jobs that you may be 

qualified for after completing this program. 

To start, I've got a question for you. 

How many open roles do you think 

are out there for project managers? 

Hint: The answer is a very big number. 

Project managers are in high demand. 

In 2017, a study by 

the Project Management Institute 

found that by the year 2027, 

employers will need 87.7 

million people filling project management-aligned roles. 

According to that same study, 

the industries with the most growth 

are manufacturing and construction, 

information services and publishing, 

management and professional services, 

finance and insurance, utilities, 

and oil and gas. 

Project management plays a big part in 

helping all of these industries grow. 

In some industries, you will 

find the term "project manager" 

grouped with a more industry-specific qualifying word. 

For example: "construction project manager" 

or "IT project manager," 

or "engineering project manager." 

Don't worry. These are all still project manager roles—they're 

just specific to an industry. 

And it's important to keep in mind 

that the skills you learn in 

one industry can be applied to another industry. 

New projects are popping up every single day. 

Across all industries, we noticed 

that new technology is introduced, 

which leads to processes 

changing and a need to manage those processes. 

So all kinds of companies need people like you who can tackle 

a variety of projects from start to finish, 

to help them navigate these changes. 

By now, you might have noticed 

that you already have some of those skills, 

like organizing or planning an event, problem-solving, 

or even managing a budget, 

and you use them effectively in your everyday life. 

Reflect on some of 

those skills we mentioned earlier and ask yourself, 

what are some of the parts of 

project management that you're drawn to? 

While you may not have the answer just yet, 

thinking about these things can help 

you find suitable roles later. 

As you keep going in this program, 

try to keep track of the lessons 

and activities you prefer 

and the ones you didn't like as much. 

This will help you narrow your choices 

as you search through job boards later. 

The beauty of project management 

is that you don't need to be 

an expert on a focused technical topic— 

you just need to be able to manage projects. 

You could be a construction 

or technology project manager, 

or you could enter 

the healthcare industry and work in patient management. 

You could also enter the energy sector 

and act as an environmental project manager. 

The possibilities are almost endless. 

What's equally exciting is that you could even 

end up with a completely different title altogether. 

For instance, there are roles that entail a sequence of 

ongoing projects that are 

considered programs or operations in the industry. 

In this case, the role may not be 

described as a project manager, 

but instead something a little more evergreen, like 

"operations manager" or "program manager." 

Other titles that might make sense for you 

can include "operations assistant," 

"project assistant," 

"project coordinator," and "program assistant." 

When it comes to job duties, 

your responsibilities might change 

depending on the type of company you choose. 

For example, the workload and 

specific tasks at a small agency 

will be different from those at Google. 

It's also important to keep in mind that 

as the world continues to change and evolve, 

so do industries and 

the job opportunities you'll find there. 

So be sure to cast a wide net. 

You'll be able to find more and more jobs 

you're qualified for. 

In addition to being qualified for 

project management-related jobs, 

there's plenty of other roles 

or paths that may interest you. 

Internships can sometimes be a good place to start. 

An internship is a short-term way to 

get hands-on experience in an industry. 

Plus, internships are a great way to help boost 

your resume and set yourself apart from other candidates. 

One of the key benefits of internships 

is that you get real work experience while 

simultaneously networking with people 

in that industry. It's a win-win. 

Now some internships in your field might 

not technically be project manager roles, 

but a lot of roles are easily transferable. 

For example, something like 

an "events manager intern" role can become 

a full-time project manager position later on. 

Internships aren't great for everyone's lifestyle, 

but if you can make them work, 

they're a fantastic option. 

Another path you can take is contract work. 

Working for companies on a contract means you'll 

work with them on a project-by-project basis, 

but you won't be a full-time employee. 

This kind of work is a great way to get your foot in 

the door and build your portfolio. Plus, 

it gives you the flexibility to try 

your hand at a few different projects at once, 

depending on the commitment level required for that. 

Another benefit of contracting is that it lets you 

explore different kinds of companies and project types. 

Since it's a temporary position, 

you can explore what type of 

company is the best fit for you. 

Maybe you find you like working with a 

large or a small team, 

or you find you enjoy specific types of projects. 

And if you find a situation that suits 

you and the organization, 

your contract position might 

just lead to a full-time position. 

As you keep charging forward, 

try thinking about the type of job you might be 

interested in going after when we're done here. 

Every new topic you discover brings you one 

step closer to your first role in project management, 

and one step closer to where you want to be. 

In the next video, we'll 

learn how to identify and search for 

job titles best-suited for 

a project manager. We'll see you there.



## Explore project management roles

You are about to start on your path to securing a high-demand position as a project manager. One of the greatest benefits of the project management field is that it encompasses a wide variety of positions across numerous industries. As you complete this certification, you will acquire skills that will qualify you for various job titles. Here, we will discuss some different project management job categories and some common roles within those categories. We’ll also describe the great potential for career progression in project management, from entry-level positions to senior program management roles, and the many opportunities in between! 

#### **Project management job categories and common roles** 

##### **Introductory-level project management roles**

Entry-level project management positions are a great opportunity to get your foot in the door and learn the ins and outs of how a company operates and manages projects. The lessons you learn from these experiences are extremely valuable to your growth in project management. Some entry-level project management positions include:

- **Junior Project Manager:** Performs all aspects of being a project manager alongside a more experienced professional.
- **Project Administrator:** Assists the rest of the project team with administrative tasks. 
- **Project/Program Assistant**: Supports team members working on a project and offers administrative support. May perform research or create training documents along with other jobs as assigned by program leaders.
- **Project/Program Coordinator:** Participates in hands-on project work and administrative tasks. Works under a project manager to make sure projects are completed on time and within budget.
- **Project Support Specialist:** Works alongside a project manager and team members to oversee assigned projects. May also be responsible for training and developing employees to perform designated tasks.

##### **Traditional project management roles**

Once you have gained some experience in introductory-level positions, you can explore traditional project management roles, such as:

- **Project Manager:** Responsible for the initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing of a project. Includes industry-specific titles like IT project manager, construction project manager, or engineering project manager, which utilize skills that are transferable among industries.
- **Project Analyst:** Moves a project along by sharing information, providing support through data analysis, and contributing to strategy and performance. 
- **Project Leader/Director:** Drives core decision-making and sets the direction for the project. Usually knowledgeable about the product or deliverable. 
- **Project Controller:** Primarily responsible for project planning. You are likely to see this job title in industries like engineering and construction.
- **Technical Project Manager:** Conducts project planning and management for identified goals within a company. Ensures that projects are completed to the requirements within a defined time frame and budget.
- **Project Management Office (PMO) Analyst:** Manages the progress of complex projects to ensure timely execution and completion. 

##### **Program and portfolio management roles**

As you have learned, project managers are responsible for the day-to-day management of projects. They shepherd projects from start to finish and serve as a guide for their team. Project managers must apply the right tools, techniques, and processes to complete the project successfully, on time, and within budget. 

After you have carried out projects successfully and feel you are ready for a step up in responsibility, a program manager position may be the next step for you. While a project is one single-focused endeavor, a **program** is a collection of projects. Program managers are responsible for managing many projects. At Google, all project managers are called program managers because they manage multiple projects simultaneously. 

Successfully implementing programs as a program manager can eventually make you a great fit for more senior positions, such as a senior program manager or a portfolio manager. A **portfolio** is a collection of projects and programs across an entire organization. Portfolio managers are responsible for portfolios of projects or programs for one client. Over the course of your career, you might progress from project manager to program manager to portfolio manager roles.

While project, program, and portfolio managers hold different types and levels of responsibility, they are all project managers. In Course 4 of this certificate program, you will learn more about differentiating projects, programs, and portfolios.



![Graphic of project manager > program manager > portfolio manager](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/EBTy61fHRGSU8utXx-Rkdw_8a0eb610f69448eeb2c9969d86b70f92_Google_Readings_Stills_PGM_C6-Resume-Graphics-1-.png?expiry=1688169600000&hmac=rRTg1WmxcBZ2HZQpHkjHPGaSKlO-vSeZCyJI_rJXm4Y)

- **Program managers:** Manage a group of projects that are related or similar to one another and handle the coordination of these projects. They facilitate effective communication between individual project managers and provide support where necessary. They also help create and manage long-term goals for their organization.
- **Portfolio managers**: Responsible for managing a group of related programs within the same organization. They coordinate various programs in order to ensure they are on track and that the organization is meeting its strategic initiatives. Portfolio managers look at all projects and programs within the organization and prioritize work as necessary. 

##### **Operational management roles** 

In operational management roles, you will get the opportunity to experience several different departments and how they interact and operate. Operational management roles allow you to work alongside peers and management from various business segments, giving you an appreciation for what each segment does on a daily basis. Key elements of project management include making sure a project is on budget and on schedule. This course, and your experience as a project manager, will give you the tools to be able to apply those skills to running a business. Some operational management positions include:

- **Operations Analyst:** Manages and coordinates research, investigates workflows, creates business procedures, and recommends changes to improve the project and company. 
- **Operations Manager:** Oversees strategic decision-making and rolls out plans of action based on financial, schedule, and resource reporting. 
- **Chief Operating Officer:** Responsible for overseeing the day-to-day administrative and operational functions of a business.

##### **Agile roles**

We will discuss the Agile project management approach in depth later, but here are a couple of the positions you may see that are related to that approach:

- **Scrum Master:** Coordinates and guides the Scrum team. Knowledgeable in Agile framework and Scrum and is able to teach others about the Scrum values and principles. May also be listed as a Technical Program Manager or Technical Project Manager. 
- **Product Owner:** Drives the direction of product development and progress. 

##### **Industry-specific management roles**

As you search for project management roles, you may see positions with titles like “engineering project manager” or “construction project manager.” Keep in mind that the skills you learn in one industry can be applied to another industry. For example, you may have experience as a software engineer but are interested in pursuing a career in project management. You will be able to apply what you’ve learned working in a technical field, as well as with the skills you have picked up in this certification course, to a project manager position in multiple industries. Having experience working on a team to achieve a task and understanding how to execute an effort on schedule and on budget are aspects of your professional experience—combined with your project management knowledge—that make it possible for you to move between industries.

Project management is a career path with a great deal of potential! 

With each step along your career path, you are building yourself up to be a significant contributor to any company. We have discussed a number of possible job titles for you to search for when you start exploring project management roles. Regardless of the industry in which you currently work, you have gained **transferable skills**. Transferable skills are abilities that can be used in many different jobs and career paths. Your transferable skills can likely be utilized in project management roles in many other industries. 



## Finding the perfect role

Hi again! Let's discuss how to search 

for a job in the project management field. 

It's no secret that job searching can be a challenge. 

Even the most detailed, 

specific job listings can leave you 

wondering what the company is 

really seeking in a candidate. 

Don't worry, we've all been there, and we're here to help 

you sort through the lingo and the confusion. 

The more job listings you find, 

the more buzzwords you'll likely notice, too— 

words like "data-driven," "team player," "self-starter." 

Understanding all the buzzwords in 

job listings will help 

figure out if a job is right for you. 

Up to now, we've discussed project management as a role, 

but many companies actually list it as 

a skill. Here's some more good news. 

You'll soon be qualified for 

a position as a project manager, 

and a position that lists project management as a skill. 

Here's the even better news. 

If you have the skills to manage projects, 

you'll be qualified for 

program manager or operational roles 

that require you to manage an end-to-end 

system or department, too, 

which asks for the same skill set. 

Now, let's check out different types of jobs 

that use your project management skills. 

When job hunting, keep your options open. 

As I just mentioned, 

you don't have to limit yourself to 

just project manager titles. 

There's lots of other titles you're qualified for, too. 

You'll know what's a good fit for you 

by reading the job descriptions, 

so cast a wide net. 

Depending on the field you choose, 

you might find roles like Operations Manager, 

Program Manager, 

Operations Associate, or Project Assistant. 

All of these could be a great fit for your skills. 

For example, let's say you're 

searching a job board for project management roles 

when you notice a Community Operations Manager role 

for a small city open up. 

The job title isn't project manager, 

but you'll notice that the job functions match your skill 

set, and your years of 

experience also match the job requirements. 

The job description may include a list of 

required skills like organizational management, 

strong planning and communication skills, 

budget preparation and monitoring. 

Sound familiar? Maybe you'll even start to notice that 

the job's responsibilities seem 

like tasks you've covered in this course, 

like creating monthly status reports, 

helping to implement new and necessary technologies, 

tracking work plans and performance metrics, 

assisting other members of 

the operations team on given projects, 

and ensuring timely responses 

to requests for information. 

These duties are nearly a perfect match 

for your project management skills, 

and there are plenty more listings like these, too. 

How great is that? 

The skills that go into project management are 

used in all kinds of roles and professions. 

Believe it or not, we've all worked with or learned 

from a project manager at some point in the past. 

Can you guess who that is? 

It's your teachers! Think about it. 

Everything that goes into being 

a teacher takes project management skills: 

Designing a curriculum that's accessible to 

students with unique needs; managing a budget; 

communicating with others like parents, 

department heads, or school admins; 

developing processes to make things run 

efficiently in the classroom; and so on. 

For example, 

when I went for my first interview at Google, 

I highlighted my experience as 

the founder and advisor to a student leadership group. 

I told them about how I assembled and led a team of 

20 students to plan and execute events like fundraisers, 

community gatherings, and academic assemblies for 

over 300 students during the academic year. 

I even kind of surprised myself, 

looking back at how much relevant 

project management experience I had. 

Now, I'm sure you'll think back on 

your own experiences and feel the same thing. 

One more thing to call out is networking. 

Networking is when you meet other people in 

a professional setting with the goal of learning, 

sharing knowledge, and creating new business connections. 

This plays a big role in job hunting, 

so it is a great tool to start learning and perfecting. 

The skills you learn here will prepare you 

for all kinds of project management jobs. 

Knowing how to search for 

jobs will make it even easier to 

match those skills with the best opportunities for you.
