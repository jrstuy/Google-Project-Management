Wondering-想知道 how I started my own career in project management? Well, in college-大学, I always gravitated-被吸引到 towards things that were more hands-on-动手的 and action-oriented-行动向导 and less theoretical-理论的. I wanted to make an impact-巨大影响 in whichever-无论哪个 career-职业 I took on. My first job out of college was as a Spanish-西班牙语 and leadership-领导力 teacher in Los Angeles, California. My main objective-目标,目的 in guiding the student leadership team at the school was to identify, mobilize-组织,调动, and inspire-激励,鼓励 the student leaders. After two years of teaching, I realized-意识到 that the moments-片刻 when I felt-觉得 the most energized-使活跃 were when I was building a vision-愿景 for how to get a big project done or when I was working to bring different groups together around a common goal. 

That's when I realized-认识到,意识到 I had a lot of core project management skills, and I could **focus on**-专注于 growing and developing them in the business world.

# Understanding the basics of project management

## What is project management?

Hey, again! Let's get back into it. 

In this video, we'll define-定义 a project, define-定义 project management, and explain its value to an organization. Let's start by defining exactly-精确地,确切地 what a project is. 

A project, is a unique endeavor-尽力,努力, and usually-通常地,经常地 includes a set of unique deliverables. It's also a temporary pursuit-追求. It has a defined-明确 beginning and an end. To put it another way, a project is a series of tasks that need to be completed to reach a desired-期望得到的 outcome-结果,效果. Reaching that desired-期望得到的 outcome takes collaboration-合作,协作 and careful planning that keeps the project on track and on budget. 

That's where project management comes in. -这就是项目管理的用武之地。

Project management is critical-关键的 to the success of projects both big and small. Let's break it down into the what, the why, and the how. 

What is project management? 

Why is project management an important part of an organization? 

How is it vital-至关重要的,必不可少的 to a project's success? 

As I mentioned-提到,谈到, project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired-期望得到的 outcome. Project management is valuable to businesses because it helps ensure that a project delivers the expected-预料的,预期的 outcomes, both on time and within budget. To demonstrate-证明 what I mean I'll take you through a real-life example of project management. 

Imagine a **school district**-学区 **signs a deal**-签订协议 with a telehealth-远程医疗 company to make sure students don't have to miss school for simple health issues, like fevers-发烧,发热 or headaches-头痛,头疼. The deal-交易 will be completed by the end of the school year. The students can now interact-相互交流 with the doctor through a tablet, smartphone-智能手机, or a computer, while they're at school. Implementing-执行,贯彻 this technology into the school's procedures-程序 is the project. It's got a clear outcome and start and end date. 

So, how is that project managed? 

Well, this project has several-几个,数个 tasks, and each one has to be carefully planned out and tracked, or managed, **in order for**-为了 the project to be completed. For example, to start you can organize training-培训,训练 sessions for faculty-全体教员 to get them better acquainted-使熟悉 with the technology, policies, and procedures-程序. You can budget for tablets, computers, and other vital-必不可少的 equipment-设备 to facilitate-使便利,促进,推动 the virtual-虚拟的 checkups-审查,检查. You can maintain-保持,维护 strong communication with doctors, the telehealth-远程医疗 company, and school **staff-全体员工 members**-工作人员 and so much more. To successfully launch-发动,发起 the product in the schools all of those things need to get done. 

That is project management. Seems pretty-相当,颇 important to an organization's success, right? 

More and more companies are starting to understand how project management can save-节省 them lots of money and time. Poor-劣质的 project management can lead to trillions-万亿 of wasted-浪费掉的 dollars every year for organizations around the world. More specifically, poor project management can lead to 48 percent-百分之 of projects missing delivery dates, 43 percent missing budget targets, and 31 percent failing-未能做到 to meet an organization's goals. 

As a company that serves so many different purposes-目的,目标 in communities-社区, it's no surprise that project management's a huge-庞大的,极大的 part of Google. 

But here, many of our project managers are described as "program managers," because they manage multiple projects for specific products, teams, or programs. There are thousands-数千 of people here with the job of keeping projects and programs running smoothly-平稳地. 

People like me. I'm a responsible-负责的 innovation革新,创新 program manager. My team is responsible for ensuring that the technology we produce, the research we pursue-追求,致力于, and the publications-出版物 we put out are all done with Google's artificial-人造的,人工的 intelligence-智力,才智 principles in mind. 

I review the processes for each of these types of technologies, and I give ideas for how to continue innovating-革新,改革 responsibly-认真负责地 to meet our organizational goals. 

My job adds value to Google through the core aspects-方面 of project management we've mentioned-提及,说起, planning and organizing, managing tasks, and budgeting and controlling costs. 

Hopefully you have a better sense-理解力 of what a project is, what project management is, and why project management is an important part of every company, and how it's vital to a project's success. 

Next up, we'll learn more about what a project manager does.



## What does a project manager do?

Hey, so we've covered what project management is and why it's important to organizations. Now, let's learn more about what project managers do on a **day-to-day basis**-日常. 

Project managers usually follow a process that involves-牵涉,涉及 planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs and other factors-因素,要素. Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and on budget. **In broad-广泛的 terms**-大体上, a project manager also needs to make sure that the project outcome is bringing value to the company. 

A project manager can add value in many different ways. Whether that's creating a new service for customers or modifying an old service so it's more tailored-特制的,专门的 to the customer's needs. **No matter**-无论如何 what the task is, a successful project will always add value. And it's the project manager's job to make sure that project is both valuable and successful. 

You may be asking yourself, well, if I'm a project manager, how do I add value to an organization every day? What does the day-to-day life of a project manager look like? Well, a project manager's responsibilities can vary-不同的,呈现差异, depending on the project, the industry-行业,领域, and the company they're working in. 

Are you constructing a new building? 

Are you project managing a renewable-可再生的 energy-能源 product in a startup-初创公司? 

Or are you setting up your own event-活动 management company? 

Your tasks will be different in each scenario, but here's a general-总体的 overview of what a typical-典型的,一贯的 day might look like.



A project manager's daily responsibilities always include some version of the following, planning and organizing. An example of that might be gathering-收集,采集 requirements from teammates or customers. This means **figuring out**-弄清楚,理解 what exactly-究竟,到底 your project's trying to accomplish. You might have a kickoff-开始 meeting or send a survey. From here you may also work on creating project plans. Creating project plans is a key part of project management. It helps set the tone-风格 of the project, keeps everyone on pace-速度,节奏 and aligned-使一致, and helps move tasks along-向前. 

Which leads me to my second point, managing tasks. Once-一旦 the project is underway-在进行中的, the project manager helps manage tasks for the team members and communicates-传达,传递 key milestones-里程碑 to the larger team or customers. This helps keep team members, and customers updated on how the project is progressing-进步,进展. 

The third piece-部分 is budgeting and controlling costs and other factors. Managing the budget and controlling costs is a common responsibility that project managers have to understand to keep the project on track-轨道 and within-在...范围内 budget. 

This is a **full-time**-专职的,全日制的 job because the plan you've created and managed may change causing unexpected costs to come up. And that's just to **name a few**-列举几个. I could go on for days. But the most important thing to know about the day to day of a project manager is this: 

You'll use different tools, techniques and methodologies every single day. There's never a dull-枯燥无聊的 moment. 

Personally-就个人而言, my favorite part about being a project manager is that I get to watch the project's growth from start to finish. 

It's really special to create something from nothing, working from the **ground up**-从零开始. 

It's a really satisfying-令人满意的,令人满足的 feeling.

See you there.



## Transferable可转让的,可转移的 project management skills

Welcome back. Let's get right into it and explore the variety of skills you'll use. 

Have you ever-曾经 been tasked with planning a loved one's surprise-令人惊奇的 birthday party? 

There's usually a lot of pressure-压力 and responsibility, but when you get it right, it feels amazing. That's still true even if there were **a couple of**-几个 issues. Maybe the guest-客人 of honor-尊敬 arrived home earlier than expected-预料的,预期的 and nearly-几乎,差不错 ruined-毁灭 the surprise. But if you made someone feel special on their birthday you probably planned a successful project. As you chose a venue-发生地点,场所, sent out invitations, and calculated your budget based on your number of guests, you were using several-几个,数个,不同的 project management skills, like planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling costs, and more. Or maybe you've never planned a party. 

Have you ever worked in the retail-零售 space-场所, or in the service industry? 

Then you might have experience that'll translate into the project management field, too. For example, you might have been in 

charge of managing several-几个,数个,不同的 employees' schedules. To do that, you had to plan and organize which employees' work styles would complement-补充,补足 each other in a productive-多产的 way. You also had to make sure that all duties-职责 and responsibilities would be covered during-在...期间 each shift-轮班. Plus, you had to be aware-知道的,明白的 of all employees' availability. 

Doesn't sound familiar-熟悉的? 

Well, have you ever-曾经 had to relocate-调动,搬迁,迁移 for a new job and planned a big move? 

To successfully move all of your belongings, you may have coordinated-协调,配合 friends and family to help. You would have had to budget and control costs for moving companies, boxes, and miscellaneous-各种各样的 expenses-费用. You probably packed-充满的,装满的 your boxes one room at a time and clearly-清楚地,清晰地 labeled the boxes so that you knew what each box was when you arrived at the new place. You had to manage all of these tasks simultaneously-同时地. You've likely handled several tasks like these in your lifetime. In studying project management, you'll learn to further advance-前进,进步 and sharpen-改善,提高 these skills so that you'll be equipped-装备,配备 to manage even bigger, more daunting-使人畏惧的 tasks. The abilities that helped you complete these past projects are a great **selling point**-卖点 for yourself as a future project manager. So be sure to bring up these examples in job interviews-面试,访谈 to demonstrate-证明 your skills. 

For instance, if you're asked questions like, "Tell me about a time when you had to juggle-平衡,尽力应付 several tasks at once", or "Tell me about a time when you had to influence-影响,作用 a customer or a teammate." 

It's good to have examples that demonstrate-证明 your skills with time management and leadership in both your everyday life and previous workplaces. 

Are you thinking about all of the skills that you already have and can use in your future project management role? 

Perfect. Up next, we'll learn more about the types of project management roles that you'll be qualified-有资格的 for after this program. We'll also discuss how to start exploring the various job opportunities **out there for you**-等着你. See you soon.



## X: Path-途径 to becoming a project manager

Hey everyone, my name is X. Yes, just the letter-字面确切含义. 

At Google, I'm a Program Manager for a department-部门 called Responsible Innovation-革新,创新. Most of us, in our everyday life, use program management. When you have only a couple-几个 hours left-剩余的 in a day and you have to **figure-理解 out**-弄清楚, well, do I clean-清洁,打扫 my house or do I go to the grocery-食品杂货店 store? 

How long will each of those task takes? Those are just different elements or variations-变化,变动 of program management and project management. My path-道路,途径 to program management is pretty non-traditional-非传统的. I didn't go graduate-大学毕业 from a great college-大学. In fact, I **dropped out of**-退学 high school and I dropped out of college. So a GED-普通教育开发 is the highest credential that I have. After I dropped out of high school, I taught myself how to code. I built a whole bunch-大量 of websites, but realized, like, I didn't have the responsible skills to make me a "**mature adult**-成熟的成年人." So I ended up joining the military-军方. After spending eight years in the Army-陆军,军队, I traveled the world building apps for really big companies and governments-政府 around the world. When I came into Google, I realized-意识到 I could still be technical, but then I'm just using the skills I already have. 

So how can I grow myself as a person by learning new skills? 

That's when I heard about the program manager role. The program manager role at Google is super cool because it varies-不同,改变 **depending on**-取决于 which team you're on. If you're a program manager on Google Cloud, that could look very different than being a program manager in YouTube. That switch up and that change from coding all day long in front of a computer screen was something that was really, really attractive-吸引人的 to me. Some of the biggest skills from my past and my history that helped me become a program manager and make that transition from somebody who was managed by program and project managers, to actually-实际上,事实上 becoming one myself, was taking a little bit more accountability-责任,责任心 in my personal life. There's lots of things I want to learn in life. I started doing things like making schedules to practice, like, different instruments-乐器, like the **bass guitar**-贝斯吉他. 

Each of my roles, whenever-每当 I worked with a project or program manager, I also made sure to **check in**-登记,记录 with them about why they were doing what they were doing. I'm someone who doesn't really learn from books if you can't tell by me dropping out of school. So I always found somebody who was willing to teach me why they were doing what they were doing, because that's how I learn. I tend-倾向于 to be more kinetic-运动的,活跃的. I learn as I go. Program management to me was a natural-自然的 calling-召唤. Not because I like to run around and tell everybody what to do, but because I have a real personal passion-激情,热情 for bringing people together and getting everybody on the same page to move towards the same goal. Whether that's convincing-说服,劝服 all my friends to go to my favorite vegan-严格素食的 spot-地点,场所 in downtown-市中心的 LA, like four times a week, or whether that's getting us all together to resolve conflict-争执,争论 or to work on an idea and collaborate on projects on the side together. Those skills that you use in your everyday life to keep your task together can apply to program and project management very easily. You just have to be a little bit more intentional-故意的,蓄意的 around them and there's a lot more paperwork-文书工作 involved-忙于...的.





# Learning about careers in project management

## From certificate to career success

Welcome back. Now that you have a general understanding of what a project manager does, let's focus on the types of jobs that you may be qualified-胜任的 for after completing this program. 

To start, I've got a question for you. How many open roles do you think are out there for project managers? 

Hint-提示,暗示: The answer is a very big number. Project managers are in high demand-需要,需求. 

In 2017, a study by the Project Management Institute found that by the year 2027, employers will need 87.7 million people filling-填补 project management-aligned roles. According-相应的,相符的 to that same study, the industries-行业 with the most growth are manufacturing-制造,制造业 and construction-建造业, information services and publishing, management and professional services, finance and insurance, utilities-实用工具, and oil and gas. 

Project management plays **a big part**-很大的作用 in helping all of these industries-行业 grow. 

In some industries-行业, you will find the term-术语 "project manager" grouped with a more industry-specific-特定的 qualifying-达到要求 word. For example: "construction project manager" or "IT project manager," or "engineering-工程 project manager." Don't worry. These are all still-仍然 project manager roles—they're just specific-特定于 to an industry. And it's important to **keep in mind**-牢记 that the skills you learn in one industry can be applied to another industry. New projects are **popping up**-弹出 every single day. Across-遍及 all industries, we noticed that new technology is introduced-引进, which **leads to**-导致 processes-流程 changing and a need to manage those processes. So all **kinds of**-各种 companies need people like you who can tackle-应付,解决 a variety of projects from start to finish, to help them navigate-处理,引路 these changes. 

By now, you might have noticed-注意到 that you already have some of those skills, like organizing or planning an event, problem-solving, or even managing a budget, and you use them effectively-有效地,实际上 in your everyday life. Reflect-反映 on **some of those skills**-其中的一些技能 we mentioned-提及,说到 earlier and ask yourself, what are some of the parts of project management that **you're drawn-绘制 to**?-你被吸引到 

While you may not have the answer just yet, thinking about these things can help you find suitable-适宜的,合适的 roles later. As you keep going in this program, try to keep **track of**-跟踪 the lessons and activities you prefer and the ones you didn't like as much. This will help you narrow-缩小 your choices as you search through job boards later. The beauty of project management is that you don't need to be an expert-专家 on a focused-集中,关注 technical topic— you just need to be able to manage projects. You could be a construction or technology project manager, or you could enter the healthcare-医疗保健服务 industry and work in patient-病人,患者 management. You could also enter the energy-能源 sector-部门 and act-担任 as an environmental project manager. The possibilities-可能性 are almost-几乎,差不多 endless-无止境的,无穷尽的. 

---

What's equally-同样地 exciting is that you could even end up with a completely different title altogether-总之. For instance, there are roles that entail-需要 a sequence of ongoing projects that are considered programs or operations in the industry. In this case, the role may not be described as a project manager, but instead something a little more evergreen-经久不衰的, like "operations manager" or "program manager." Other titles that might make sense-有意义的 for you can include "operations assistant-助理," "project assistant," "project coordinator," and "program assistant." When it **comes to**-涉及 job duties, your responsibilities-职责 might change depending on the type of company you choose. 

For example, the workload-工作量 and specific-具体的 tasks at a small agency-机构 will be different from those at Google. It's also important to **keep in mind**-牢记 that as the world continues to change and evolve-进化,演化, so do industries and the job opportunities you'll find there. So be sure to cast-撒 a wide-广泛的,宽的 net. You'll be able to find more and more jobs you're qualified for. **In addition to**-除此之外 being qualified for project management-related jobs, there's plenty-富裕,充裕 of other roles or paths that may interest you. Internships-实习 can sometimes be a good place to start. 

An internship is a short-term-短期的 way to get hands-on-动手的,实际操作的 experience in an industry. Plus-外加,而且, internships are a great way to help boost-推动,促进 your resume-简历 and set yourself apart-与众不同的 from other candidates-候选人,申请者. One of the key benefits of internships is that you get real work experience while simultaneously-同时地 networking-建立人脉 with people in that industry. It's a win-win-双赢的,互利互惠的. 

Now some internships in your field might not technically be project manager roles, but a lot of roles are easily transferable. For example, something like an "events manager intern-实习生" role can become a full-time project manager position **later on**-过后. Internships aren't great for everyone's lifestyle-生活方式, but if you can make them work, they're a fantastic-极好的 option. 

Another path you can take is contract work. Working for companies on a contract means you'll work with them on a project-by-project basis, but you won't be a full-time employee. This kind of work is a great way to get your **foot in the door**-成功的第一步 and build your portfolio-投资组合. Plus, it gives you the flexibility-灵活性,弹性 to try your hand at a few different projects at once, depending on the commitment-投入 level-程度 required-需要 for that. Another benefit of contracting-订立合同 is that it lets you explore different kinds of companies and project types. Since-由于 it's a temporary position-职位, you can explore what type of company is the best fit-适合 for you. Maybe you find you like working with a large or a small team, or you find you enjoy specific types of projects. And if you find a situation-工作,职位 that suits-使适合 you and the organization, your contract position might just lead to a full-time position. 

As you keep charging-冲锋 forward, try thinking about the type of job you might be interested in going after when we're done here. Every new topic you discover brings you one step closer-靠近的 to your first role in project management, and one step closer to where you want to be. 

In the next video, we'll learn how to identify and search for job titles best-suited-最合适的 for a project manager. We'll see you there.

## Finding the perfect-完美的 role

Don't worry, we've all been there, and we're here to help you **sort through**-整理,筛选 the lingo-行话,术语 and the confusion-困惑,不明确.

These duties are nearly a perfect-完美的,无瑕的 match for your project management skills, and there are plenty-富裕,充裕 more listings like these, too. 

> 听起来是不是很熟悉?也许你甚至会开始注意到，这份工作的职责看起来就像你在本课程中所涉及的任务，比如创建月度状态报告，帮助实施新的和必要的技术，跟踪工作计划和绩效指标，协助运营团队的其他成员完成给定的项目，并确保及时响应信息请求。这些职责几乎与你的项目管理技能完美匹配，而且还有很多类似的清单。

> 项目管理的技能适用于各种角色和职业。信不信由你，在过去的某个时候，我们都和项目经理一起工作过，或者从项目经理那里学过东西。

Can you guess who that is? 

> 你能猜到那是谁吗?

It's your teachers! Think about it. Everything that goes into being a teacher takes project management skills: 

> 是你的老师!想想看。作为一名教师，一切都需要项目管理技能:

Designing a curriculum-课程 that's accessible-可以理解的 to students with unique-独特的 needs; 

> 设计适合有特殊需求的学生可以理解的课程;

managing a budget; 

> 管理预算

communicating with others like parents, department heads, or school admins; 

> 与他人沟通，如家长、部门主管或学校管理人员;

developing processes to make things run efficiently-高效地 in the classroom; and so on. 

> 制定流程，使课堂高效运行;等等。

For example, when I went-去,过去 for my first interview-面试,面谈 at Google, I highlighted my experience as the founder and advisor to a student leadership group. I told them about how I assembled-聚集 and led-领导 a team of 20 students to plan and execute events like fundraisers-资金筹集人, community gatherings-聚会, and academic-学业的,学术的 assemblies-集会 for over 300 students during the academic year. I even kind of surprised myself, looking back at how much relevant-有关的 project management experience I had. 

> 例如，当我第一次去谷歌面试时，我强调了我作为一个学生领导小组的创始人和顾问的经历。我告诉他们，我如何组织并领导一个由20名学生组成的团队，在学年期间为300多名学生策划和执行筹款活动、社区聚会和学术集会等活动。我甚至有点惊讶自己，回顾我有这么多相关的项目管理经验。

Now, I'm sure you'll think back on your own experiences and feel the same thing. One more thing to **call out**-呼喊 is networking-建立人脉. Networking is when you meet-满足,应付 other people in a professional setting with the goal of learning, sharing knowledge, and creating new business connections. This plays a big role in job hunting-搜寻,搜索, so it is a great tool to start learning and perfecting-完美,完善. The skills you learn here will prepare you for all kinds of project management jobs. Knowing how to search for jobs will make it even easier to match those skills with the best opportunities for you.

> 现在，我相信你会回想起自己的经历，并有同样的感觉。还有一点需要注意的是人际关系。网络是指你在一个专业的环境中与他人见面，目的是学习、分享知识，并建立新的业务关系。这在找工作中起着很大的作用，所以这是一个开始学习和完善的好工具。你在这里学到的技能将为你从事各种项目管理工作做好准备。知道如何寻找工作将使你更容易将这些技能与最好的机会相匹配。



## Gilbert: Project management skills in my role

My name is Gilbert, and I'm a talent-人才 outreach-拓展 specialist-专家 here at Google. Talent-天赋 can mean many things; it can mean folks-人们 that have never envisioned-想象,预想 themselves at Google. And so part of our team's remit-职权范围 is to identify talent that Google or other companies may not necessarily reach out to, or consider for roles in the past and helping them navigate-导航,引路 the interview process. That could also mean candidates-候选人,申请者 that are already interested or have expressed interest in opportunities at Google in the past, and engaging-吸引 them to support them through the interview process today. 

> 我叫吉尔伯特，是谷歌的一名人才拓展专家。天赋可以意味着很多东西;它可能意味着那些从未想过自己会在谷歌工作的人。因此，我们团队的职责之一就是找出谷歌或其他公司过去不一定会接触或考虑的人才，并帮助他们顺利度过面试过程。这也可能意味着候选人过去已经对谷歌的机会感兴趣或表示有兴趣，并在今天的面试过程中与他们接触，以支持他们。

At Google you have to wear-穿,戴 the program and project management hat, regardless-不论怎样 of what role you're in. And that's definitely-肯定地,明确地 been the case for me. So in my role I've had to practice skills such as: communicating to stakeholders-利益相关者, managing a budget, managing a project timeline in many different projects within my role. 

> 在谷歌，不管你是什么角色，你都必须戴上项目和项目管理的帽子。这对我来说绝对是这样。所以在我的角色中，我必须练习一些技能，比如：与利益相关者沟通，管理预算，管理我角色中许多不同项目的项目时间表。

---

An example of this could be organizing events for university students that come to Google's campus-校园. And hear from guest-特邀嘉宾 speakers-演讲者 about the projects we work on, the roles and their career journeys. And so as you can imagine this can be a complex-复杂的,难懂的 project. My first job out of college was completely-完全地,彻底地 unrelated-无关的,不相干的 to what I'm doing now. I was an assistant manager at a big box retailer-零售店. And so a lot of the skills that I actually learned in that role have translated to support me in my role and allowed me to have success. 

> 这方面的一个例子就是为来到谷歌校园的大学生组织活动。并听取客座演讲者关于我们正在进行的项目，角色和他们的职业生涯。所以你可以想象这是一个复杂的项目。我大学毕业后的第一份工作和我现在的工作完全无关。我是一家大型零售商的副经理。因此，我在这个角色中学到的很多技能都转化为支持我的角色并使我取得成功。

So some of these skills are **being able to**-能够 talk to and have difficult-困难的 conversations-谈话,交谈, being able to manage a budget, managing resources, and managing your time. These are especially important in the retail-零售 setting. I started applying a lot of these project management frameworks or practices, even into the smallest projects. Maybe it's related to my goals for the next three months, setting up project plan based around that, right? I was the only stakeholder, I was the only one reviewing this documentation. But the practice of being able to do this really helped me so that when I had to do it for a project at Google with multiple stakeholders, with multiple timelines, competing-竞争,对抗 priorities-优先权. It was already second nature-天性 to me, because I even applied it just in my day to day. 

> 这些技能包括能够与人交谈，进行困难的交谈，能够管理预算，管理资源，管理时间。这在零售业尤为重要。我开始大量应用这些项目管理框架或实践，甚至应用到最小的项目中。也许这与我未来三个月的目标有关，并以此为基础制定项目计划，对吧？我是唯一的利益相关者，我是唯一审查这个文档的人。但是能够做到这一点的实践确实帮助了我，所以当我不得不在谷歌的一个项目中与多个利益相关者，多个时间表，竞争的优先级一起做这件事时。这已经成为我的第二天性，因为我甚至把它应用到我的日常生活中。

So I think one of the biggest support that I had **as far as**-直到 working through imposter-骗子,冒名顶替者 syndrome-综合征, or lack-缺乏,不足 of confidence-自信,信心 as I stepped into a lot of these skills is really just practice. And you can practice it in many different ways, in your personal life, in your professional-职业的,专业的 life, and anything in between. 

> 所以我认为我最大的支持之一就是克服冒名顶替综合症，或者当我开始学习这些技能时缺乏信心，这就是练习。你可以用很多不同的方式来练习它，在你的个人生活中，在你的职业生活中，以及介于两者之间的任何事情上。

So that was really important for me as I've gone through this journey of up-skilling as a program and project manager. I'd say that by joining-参加 this course and stepping-采取行动 into this, you're already taking the first step. And I think that's just as important, right? Not letting fear-恐惧,害怕,畏惧,担心, or fear of failure get **in the way**-阻碍 of new opportunities for you. And the second piece is don't be afraid-担心的 to ask for help. I think that folks-人们 are generally-通常 willing-愿意的,乐意的 to help and support you. 

> 所以这对我来说非常重要，因为我作为一个项目和项目经理经历了这段提升技能的旅程。我想说，通过参加这门课程，你已经迈出了第一步。我觉得这也很重要，对吧？不要让恐惧或对失败的恐惧阻碍你获得新机会。第二点是不要害怕寻求帮助。我认为人们通常都愿意帮助和支持你。

So the biggest thing that you can do is **reach out**-伸出援手, and not be afraid to ask questions. Not be afraid to do an informational interview, to ask for resume-简历 tips-技巧, to ask for advice from people that are maybe already in the role that you're hoping to step into, or in the field that you're looking to work in. Just reach out to them, ask them questions. I think people like to connect-建立良好关系 with folks that are intuitive-直觉的, that are curious-好奇的 and are just eager-渴望的,渴求的 to learn. And so if you can leverage-充分利用 those two pieces, I think that you're going to have success in whatever you do.

> 所以你能做的最重要的事情就是伸出援手，不要害怕问问题。不要害怕进行信息面试，向那些可能已经在你希望进入的职位上或在你希望从事的领域工作的人寻求建议。去找他们，问他们问题。所以如果你能利用这两点，我认为你无论做什么都会成功。

# Review: Embarking on a career in project management

## Wrap-up



And just like that, you're done with the first module. Congrats on hitting this exciting milestone. You're one step closer to becoming a rockstar in project management. Let's revisit the concepts we've learned so far. We started by discussing how project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome. Then we learned that project management is alive in nearly every industry and company. So you're working on an incredibly useful and versatile certification.

We also learned what a project is: 

A unique endeavor and temporary pursuit, carefully planned out to achieve a particular goal. Hopefully by now, you're familiar with the idea that every project has a defined time frame, cost, scope, and dedicated resources. We've covered some broad concepts and key terms that will help you become a successful project manager, and we've gone over how to search for jobs when that time comes. We've also discussed how to effectively translate your past experiences into talking points for why you'll be a successful project manager. We talked about how you can transfer skills from your previous job into your new project management role, and how that'll really set you apart. Everything from juggling a to-do list to budgeting for a loved one's birthday party demonstrates that you probably already have some of the skills to be a phenomenal project manager. But no worries if you don't. We're starting from scratch here. By the end of this course, you'll have the skills, but also the experience, and knowledge to find the role you want. Whether that's contract work, internships, or general project management positions, you'll be able to figure out what's the best fit for you. And as we go forward, I want to encourage you to keep thinking about what kind of work you might like to do in the future. 

And let's not forget the most exciting news we learned about project management: just about everyone needs a project manager. This position's in high demand, and that demand just keeps growing. Wow, okay. That's a lot of ground we covered, and we've just barely scratched the surface. I hope you've enjoyed the course so far because it's about to get even more fun. Coming up, we have your first graded assignment, and I know you'll ace it. Remember, take your time and relax. Trust yourself. You've got this. Don't forget, you can always review your notes and readings or go back and rewatch some of the videos if you're unsure about an answer. Good luck, and I'll see you again soon.
