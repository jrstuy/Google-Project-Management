## Overview of Classic-典型的,有代表的 and Matrix-矩阵 structures - 5min

> 经典和矩阵结构概述

Welcome back.

> 欢迎回来

In this video, I'm going to talk about the concept-概念 of organizational structure and the project manager's role within a given structure.

> 在这个视频中，我将讨论组织结构的概念和项目经理在给定结构中的角色。

Keep in mind that your role won't be the same for every team or organization, because many companies are structured differently.

> 记住，你的角色在每个团队或组织中都是不一样的，因为许多公司的结构是不同的。

But this overview will serve as a foundation for wherever you work.

> 但无论您在哪里工作，这个概述都可以作为基础。

So what is organizational structure?

> 那么什么是组织结构呢?

Organizational structure refers to the way a company or organization is arranged-安排,布置 or structured.

> 组织结构是指公司或组织的安排或结构方式。

This structure also tells you how job tasks are divided-分配 and coordinated-协调 and how all the different members of the organization relate to one another.

> 此结构还告诉您工作任务是如何划分的(和协调的)，以及组织的所有不同成员之间是如何相互关联的。

In other words, organizational structure gives you a sense of who reports to who.

> 换句话说，组织结构给你一种谁向谁报告的感觉。

But organizational structure is much more than that.

> 但组织结构远不止于此。

Understanding the different types of organizational structures can serve as a map to help you determine where you fit in, who you should communicate with, and how frequently to communicate with them.

> 了解不同类型的组织结构可以作为一个地图，帮助您确定您适合的位置，您应该与谁沟通，以及与他们沟通的频率。

Now that we have a basic overview of the definition of organizational structure, let's look at the various organizational hierarchies-层级, 分类 that you may encounter-经历,体验 at work.

> 现在我们对组织结构的定义有了一个基本的概述，让我们来看看你在工作中可能遇到的各种组织层次结构。

An organization's structure is most commonly mapped out using a reporting chart or "org chart," which is short for "organizational chart."

> 一个组织的结构通常是用报告图表或“组织结构图”来绘制的，组织结构图是“组织结构图”的缩写。

Reporting charts show the relationship between people and groups within the organization, and details who each person or group reports to.

> 报告图表显示了组织内人员和组之间的关系，以及每个人或组向谁报告的详细信息。

There are a few different types of organizational structures.

> 有几种不同类型的组织结构。

But for this course, we're going to focus on two of the more popular ones: Classic-经典的 and Matrix-矩阵.

> 但在本课程中，我们将重点关注两个更受欢迎的:经典和矩阵。

---

Let's start with Classic.

> 让我们从经典开始。

The Classic grouping includes what are usually called "functional-功能性" or "top-down-自顶向下" structures.

> 经典的分组包括通常被称为“功能性”或“自上而下”的结构。

The Classic grouping follows a typical-典型的,有代表性的 chain of command-命令 where the Chief-首席的 Executive Officer-军官, also known as CEO, and other executives-高管 are at the top, followed by directors-董事 or managers, then their direct reports and so on.

> 经典组遵循一个典型的命令链，其中首席执行官(也称为CEO)和其他高管在顶部，其次是董事或经理，然后是他们的直接报告，等等。

Each of these directors or managers typically-一般,通常 oversee teams within their function-职责 of the organization, like marketing, sales, or human resources.

> 这些主管或经理中的每一个通常都在组织的职能范围内监督团队，比如市场营销、销售或人力资源。

You can see this type of structure in effect by looking at a branch of the military-军队的.

> 你可以通过观察军队的一个分支来看到这种结构的效果。

Take the Army-军队, for example.

> 以军队为例。

You may enter-进入 the Army as a private-二等兵, and report up to a sergeant-中士 who oversees multiple people in your squad-分队, and that sergeant-中士 ultimately-最终,最后 reports up to a lieutenant-中尉 and so on.

> 你可以以列兵的身份进入军队，向一个中士汇报，这个中士负责监督你所在小队的多人，而这个中士最终向中尉汇报，以此类推。

If your organization works in this structure, as the project manager, you might communicate regularly with your manager, the person directly above-高于 you, and also with your peers who work on the same types of projects as you.

> 如果您的组织在这种结构中工作，作为项目经理，您可能会定期与您的经理(您的直接上级)以及与您从事相同类型项目的同事进行沟通。

---

There isn't always a straightforward-直接的,简单的,易懂的, top-down approach.

> 并不总是有一种直接的、自上而下的方法。

There are other factors at play that make organizational structures a bit more complicated-使复杂化 than we can see on paper.

> 还有其他因素在起作用，使组织结构比我们在纸上看到的要复杂一些。

For instance, you may have project teams that sit across-跨越,遍及 different functions-职责.

> 例如，您可能有跨多个不同职能部门的项目团队。

This is common-常见的 in many companies, Google included, and is usually referred to as the Matrix structure.

> 这在包括谷歌在内的许多公司都很常见，通常被称为矩阵结构。

You might think of a Matrix structure as a grid-网格 where you still have people above-高于 you, but you also have people in adjacent-邻近的 departments-部门 who expect-期待,预计 to hear updates on your work progress-进步,进展.

> 您可能会认为矩阵结构是一个网格，在这个网格中，您的上级仍然有人，但您也有相邻部门的人希望听到您的工作进度的更新。

These people may not be your direct bosses, but you are responsible for communicating with them, since they may inform changes to your work.

> 这些人可能不是你的直接上司，但你有责任与他们沟通，因为他们可能会通知你工作中的变化。

For example, at Google, we have the major-主要的 functions-职能 of marketing, sales, and more, with the traditional reporting chain.

> 例如，在谷歌，我们有市场营销、销售等主要职能，还有传统的报告链。

But we also have programs for our products, like Google Search, where project teams consist-由……组成 of program managers, engineers, user experience-体验 or "UX" designers, and so on, and each team member reports to their own management chains.

> 但是我们也为我们的产品制定了程序，比如Google Search，其中的项目团队由程序经理、工程师、用户体验或“UX”设计师等组成，每个团队成员向他们自己的管理链报告。

Another example is my organization.

> 另一个例子是我的组织。

It's called Global-全球的 Affairs-事务.

> 它叫做全球事务。

I have a direct manager who oversees the work I do and my core role and who is responsible for delivering my **performance-业绩,工作情况,表现 reviews**-绩效评估.

> 我有一个直接的经理，他监督我所做的工作和我的核心角色，并负责提交我的绩效评估。

But because I work with multiple people across-遍及 other teams and specialties-专业,专长, I often-常常,时常 get asked to manage projects where I'm informally working with lead program managers in other organizations.

> 但是因为我与其他团队和专业的多人一起工作，我经常被要求管理我与其他组织的主要项目经理非正式合作的项目。

Similar to my own manager, I provide updates to that program manager, seek-寻找,寻求 their approval, and solicit-征求,索求 feedback on our partnership and progress-进展.

> 与我自己的经理类似，我向项目经理提供最新情况，寻求他们的批准，并征求关于我们的伙伴关系和进展的反馈。

So to recap, the Classic structure follows a traditional, top-down system of reporting, and the Matrix structure has direct higher-ups-上级,上司 to report to and stakeholders from other departments or programs.

> 综上所述，经典结构遵循传统的，自上而下的报告系统，矩阵结构有直接的上级报告和其他部门或项目的利益相关者。

Knowing which kind of organizational structure you're working in plays a major role in how you prepare for and **carry out**-执行,实施 your project or even in an interview-面试.

> 了解你所处的组织结构对你如何准备和执行你的项目，甚至在面试中都起着重要的作用。

During an interview, you can ask about the type of organizational structure the company uses and where your role will fit in.

> 在面试中，你可以询问公司采用的组织结构类型以及你的角色适合在哪里。

This will help you and the interviewer communicate clearly about the people you will engage with daily, and the expectations-期待,预期 for the role.

> 这将有助于你和面试官清楚地沟通你每天要接触的人，以及对这个职位的期望。

In the next course, you'll hear from a Googler about a third type of structure, Project Management Office, which you might see in some of the organizations where you work or interview. Enjoy.

> 在接下来的课程中，你会听到一位谷歌员工讲述第三种结构，项目管理办公室，你可能会在你工作或面试的一些组织中看到这种结构。享受。

## How organizational structure impacts project management

> 组织结构如何影响项目管理

Hey again, ready to keep going?

> 嘿，准备好继续了吗?

The previous videos explained that knowing what kind of organizational structure you're working in plays a major role in how you prepare for and **carry out**-执行,实施 your project.

> 前面的视频解释了了解你所处的组织结构对你如何准备和执行你的项目起着重要的作用。

An organization's structure provides the framework for accountability and communication.

> 组织的结构为责任和沟通提供了框架。

As the project manager, it's vital-至关重要的,必不可少的 that you understand who you're reporting to on each project, and **just as**-正如 importantly, who the members of your team report to.

> 作为项目经理，了解在每个项目中你向谁报告是至关重要的，同样重要的是，你的团队成员向谁报告。

Knowing the organizational structure also tells you how and where to get the resources you'll need so you can get the project done efficiently.

> 了解组织结构还可以告诉您如何以及从哪里获得所需的资源，从而有效地完成项目。

When you understand the organization's structure, you'll be able to identify how it impacts the way you manage the project.

> 当您了解组织的结构时，您将能够确定它如何影响您管理项目的方式。

One way organizational structure can impact the way you manage a project is by the amount of authority given to the project manager.

> 组织结构影响项目管理方式的一种方式是通过授予项目经理的权限。

Authority has to do with your ability to make decisions for the project that impact the organization.

> 权限与您为影响组织的项目做出决策的能力有关。

In some cases, you might have the authority to do things like select the vendors who provide services or goods-商品 for the project. 

> 在某些情况下，您可能有权做一些事情，比如选择为项目提供服务或商品的供应商。

Other times, you might have a set of vendors selected for you.

> 其他时候，您可能会有一组为您选择的供应商。

Your level of authority and responsibility will vary-不同,呈现差异,改变,变化 from project to project.

> 您的权限和责任级别将因项目而异。

Another way organizational structures can impact project management is through resource availability.

> 组织结构影响项目管理的另一种方式是通过资源可用性。

Managing a project is a lot easier when you know how to access-获取,访问 the people, equipment-设备,用具, and budget that you need.

> 当你知道如何获得所需的人员、设备和预算时，管理一个项目会容易得多。

---

Let's explore how different structures can affect the way you manage a project.

> 让我们来探讨不同的结构如何影响您管理项目的方式。

In a Classic structure, you might find yourself with less authority and a tighter-更紧的,更严格的 scope.

> 在Classic结构中，您可能会发现自己的权限更少，范围更紧。

You may need to rely-相信,依靠 on getting approval-批准,许可 from the appropriate-合适的,相称的 managers, directors, and department heads in order to move forward and complete certain tasks.

> 你可能需要得到适当的经理、主管和部门主管的批准，才能向前推进并完成某些任务。

In this case-具体情况, it's likely-大概,很可能 that these people are in charge-使…承担责任 of the people on your team and the resources you need.

> 在这种情况下，这些人很可能负责管理团队中的人员和所需的资源。

As a project manager working in a Classic structure, you may depend on the managers in your organization to approve resources.

> 作为在典型的结构中工作的项目经理，您可能依赖于组织中的经理来批准资源。

In other words, the amount of people working on your project or the budget that you have allocated-分配,分派 to your project is decided by the leaders of your department or function.

> 换句话说，在你的项目中工作的人数或你分配给项目的预算是由你的部门或职能部门的领导决定的。

In a Classic structure, you may have to **go through**-经历 a chain of approvals and advocate-拥护,提倡 for more resources if you need them.

> 在经典的结构中，如果需要的话，您可能必须经过一连串的审批，并要求提供更多的资源。

For example, if you need a budget increase, you would report this to your manager.

> 例如，如果你需要增加预算，你会向你的经理报告。

Then your manager might escalate-升级,迅速增加 this up to their management chain to get approval.

> 然后，你的经理可能会把这个问题上报给他们的管理链，以获得批准。

That's the Classic structure; a traditional top-down arrangement-安排,筹备 of employees and authority.

> 这是经典结构;传统的自上而下的员工和权力安排。

---

Now, let's explore the Matrix structure.

> 现在，我们来研究一下矩阵结构。

The main difference with a Matrix structure is that employees often have two or more managers or leaders they'll need to work with and update.

> 与矩阵式结构的主要区别在于，员工通常有两个或更多的经理或领导，他们需要与之合作和更新。

Your team members will have their functional manager and you, the project manager.

> 你的团队成员将有他们的职能经理和你，项目经理。

If members are working on multiple projects, they may have even more managers.

> 如果成员在多个项目上工作，他们可能会有更多的经理。

This can affect your authority as a project manager, as you will need to cooperate-合作,协作 with more than one leader in the organization. 

> 这可能会影响您作为项目经理的权威，因为您需要与组织中的多个领导者合作。

You may need to share resources and negotiate-解决,商定 priorities.

> 你们可能需要共享资源和协商优先事项。

The key is to make sure you know who your stakeholders are and who controls what since the chain of command isn't always as clearly defined as in the Classic structure.

> 关键是要确保你知道谁是你的利益相关者，谁控制着什么，因为命令链并不总是像在经典结构中那样清晰地定义。

Because there isn't always a clear chain of command in a Matrix structure, you need to make sure you have identified and communicated with anyone you might need to report to and get approval from well before the project begins.

> 因为在矩阵结构中并不总是有一个清晰的命令链，所以您需要确保在项目开始之前就已经确定并与您可能需要报告的任何人进行沟通并获得批准。

Once this is established-建立,设立 though, your project within a Matrix structure should be able to run efficiently.

> 一旦建立了这一点，您的项目在矩阵结构应该能够有效地运行。

Matrix structures emphasize-强调,着重 a strong project focus from the team and the organization.

> 矩阵结构强调团队和组织对项目的强烈关注。

You as the project manager, generally have more autonomy-独立自主,自主权 to make decisions and gather resources as needed.

> 作为项目经理，你通常有更多的自主权来做决定和收集所需的资源。

As I hope you've noticed, the way an organization is structured can have a big impact on the planning and execution of your project.

> 正如我希望您已经注意到的那样，组织的结构方式对项目的计划和执行有很大的影响。

Understanding all of this will help you run and manage a project much more efficiently.

> 了解所有这些将有助于您更有效地运行和管理项目。

Next, I'll tell you about organizational culture, another factor that impacts how you manage your project. Catch you in a bit.

> 接下来，我将告诉您组织文化，这是影响您如何管理项目的另一个因素。一会儿见。



## The role of a Project Management Office

## Lan: Working in a Project Management Office - 3min

> 伊恩:在项目管理办公室工作

Hi, I'm Lan. I'm a Director of Program Management at Google. A program management director has a team of project managers to help execute and bring products to our users. I work on the project management team or the PMO team for a group called "Geo." And in Geo we bring geospatial products to our users. Things like Google Maps and Google Earth. And the team that I'm a part of actually works on all of the data and imagery that powers all of those products. A Project Management Office is a team of project managers. We are a group that coordinates all of the different parts of a project together, including folks who work on our product, engineers, and many business functions, and we help bring all of those ideas to life. My role specifically in working in a PMO is ensuring that we're connecting all of the different parts that are associated with projects to ensure that they are all connected together. Sometimes we find out when projects are happening, there's a piece of it here and a piece of it there, and they may not even know about each other. One of the most critical things that Project Managers get to do is they get to have a bird's eye view of everything that's happening in a project. So that's a lot of my role, and what I'm working on with my team is ensuring that all of the pieces that need to connect together actually do connect together. I've had many different roles inside of many different PMOs inside my career. All the way from taking just a piece of a part of a project when I was really early in my career, and then expanded that into taking a full end-to-end project which were smaller. And then building up my career and then moving it to really large, complex projects. And at each stage of these I have loved every piece of it. So even from the time that I had only a part of a project, I got to go really deep inside of some of those technologies and have really deep and meaningful relationships with the teams that I have been working with. And that's not always possible when you're working on a really large project that has hundreds of people. You won't be able to develop deep relationships across that large group. On the flip side, when you're working on a large, complex project, you get to see all of the different gears turning inside of a large ecosystem of things that are happening. But that took a long time in my career to build up, but at each phase of it, I realized I was learning a little bit more. And I was learning how to work a little bit more broadly and think a little bit more differently. But really ensuring how do you continue to keep the execution and rigor of a project to ensure that ideas were coming to life. One of the biggest benefits I see in working in a PMO is that you get to share a lot of best practices with each other. One of the downsides, I think for project management, is typically we don't get to work with each other because we're working with a lot of client teams and we're working with other disciplines. But a huge benefit of working in a PMO is that you get to connect with other project managers, where you can share your challenges and see how somebody else had gotten through it. Or you can share templates or tools that you may take time to develop on your own, but somebody else already has handy, so you can borrow or just steal their tool for your own use. But the best part is you have a community of people who think the same way about problems in a very methodical, in a very task-oriented, in a very action-oriented and goal-oriented way, which is not typically true if you're working across all other disciplines all the time.

When you are thinking about change management as it relates to your project, begin by asking yourself the following questions:

> 当你在考虑与项目相关的变更管理时，首先问自己以下问题:

- How will the organization react to change?

	> 组织将如何应对变化?

- Which influencers-有影响力者,有影响力的人 can affect change?

	> - 哪些影响者可以影响变革?

Let’s look at some best practices for approaching change management on your projects:

> 让我们来看看在项目中进行变更管理的一些最佳实践:

**Be proactive-积极主动的,前瞻性.**

> 采取主动

Proactive-前瞻性 and inclusive-包容广阔的,包括的 change management planning can help keep any potentially-可能地,潜在地 impacted stakeholders aware-明白的,意识到的 of the upcoming-即将来临的 changes.

> 前瞻性和包容性的变更管理计划可以帮助任何潜在受影响的利益相关者意识到即将到来的变更。

- Incorporate-包含,合并 change management into your project management steps. For example, you can schedule time during team meetings or create a feedback document to ensure that your team members know there is a place to voice-表达 their suggestions and concerns. 

	> 将变更管理纳入您的项目管理步骤。例如，您可以在团队会议期间安排时间或创建反馈文档，以确保您的团队成员知道有一个地方可以表达他们的建议和关注。

- You can also plan steps towards the end of your project to introduce the deliverable to stakeholders in **the form of**-形式 demonstrations-演示,展示, question and answer forums-论坛,讨论会, or marketing videos. You can factor all of these decisions into your plan so that any potential-潜在的,可能的 changes are less likely to impact your timeline. If these steps have not been built into your plan, you can escalate-升级 and stress the importance of a change management plan to your stakeholders. 

	> 你还可以在项目结束前计划步骤，以演示、问答论坛或营销视频的形式向利益相关者介绍可交付成果。你可以把所有这些决定都考虑到你的计划中，这样任何潜在的变化都不太可能影响你的时间表。如果您的计划中没有包含这些步骤，您可以升级并强调变更管理计划对您的涉众的重要性。

**Communicate about upcoming changes.**

>沟通即将到来的变化

Communication should occur-发生,存在 regularly among impacted stakeholders, the change management team, and the project team.

> 受影响的涉众、变更管理团队和项目团队之间应该定期进行沟通。

Check in and communicate throughout the project about how the changes will provide a better experience-体验 for end users of the project deliverables.

> 在整个项目中，检查并沟通变更将如何为项目可交付成果的最终用户提供更好的体验。

In this way, you support the process by providing everyone with the information they need to feel prepared to adjust-适应,调整,调节 to changes once the project is ready to launch-发动,发起. 

> 通过这种方式，您可以通过向每个人提供他们需要的信息来支持该过程，以便在项目准备启动时做好调整以适应变化的准备。

**Follow a consistent process.**

> 遵循一致的流程

Following a clear change management process helps maintain-保持,维持 consistency each time there is a change.

> 遵循清晰的变更管理过程有助于在每次发生变更时保持一致性。

The change management process should be established-建立,设立 and documented early on in your project to guide how the project will handle change.

> 应该在项目的早期建立并记录变更管理过程，以指导项目如何处理变更。

Your organization may also have an overarching-总体 change management plan that can be adopted for your project.

> 您的组织也可能有一个可以为您的项目采用的总体变更管理计划。

This may include when the promotion-促进 of the change should happen, when training should occur-发生,出现, when the launch-发动,发起 or release will occur, and corresponding-相一致,符合 steps for each phase of the process. 

> 这可能包括什么时候应该促进变更，什么时候应该进行培训，什么时候启动或发布，以及过程的每个阶段的相应步骤。

**Practice empathy-共鸣,同情.** 

> 实践同理心

Changes are inevitable-必然发生的,不可避免的, but we are often resistant-抵制的,反抗的 to them.

> 变化是不可避免的，但我们常常抗拒它们。

By being empathetic-同感的 to the challenges and anxiety-渴望 change can bring, you can support the process in subtle-微妙的,灵活的 ways. 

> 通过对变化可能带来的挑战和焦虑感同身受，你可以以微妙的方式支持这个过程。

**Use tools.**

> 使用工具

Incorporating-结合,合并 tools to assist-帮助,协助 in the adoption of a change can be very helpful.

> 结合工具来帮助采用变更是非常有用的。

Here are a few examples you can use on your next project:

> 这里有一些例子，你可以在你的下一个项目中使用:

- **Feedback mechanisms-机制**, such as surveys, can capture-吸引 input from stakeholders.

	> 反馈机制，如调查，可以从利益相关者那里获取输入。

- [**Flowcharts**](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/what-is-a-flowchart-tutorial) can visualize-使形象化,使显现 the project's development process.

	> 流程图可以可视化项目的开发过程。

- [**Culture mapping**](https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/posts/2015/10/13/the-culture-map-a-systematic-intentional-tool-for-designing-great-company-culture) can illustrate-阐明,说明 the company's culture and how the company's values, norms-标准,规范, and employees behavior may be affected by the change.

	> 文化映射可以说明公司的文化，以及公司的价值观、规范和员工行为如何受到变化的影响。

As the project manager, you are responsible for successfully delivering projects.

> 作为项目经理，您有责任成功交付项目。

As you hone-磨练,训练 the skill set you acquire-获得,得到 throughout this program, you will find that change management is essential-必不可少的 to your projects’ success.

## Participating in change management - 5min

> 

Hey, welcome back. In the previous video, we talked about the process of change management. Change management is actually a huge undertaking and a project in itself. As mentioned, you may not always be responsible for leading and planning the entire end-to-end change management process. Instead, you may ask a member of the project team, your manager, or another senior leader to help take on that transition. If you are participating in change management, then someone else is responsible for successfully implementing the changes. Let's say you just completed the project of creating the new check-in system. The project is now at the point where it needs to be installed and adopted by the organization, but you don't have the formal authority or influence to enact this change. Your role as a project manager then doesn't include getting employees to use the new system, that's someone else's job. But just because you're not the one directly calling for, or leading the change, there's still ways in which you can and should participate. And that's what this section is about, the process of handing off the project, and the ways in which you, as the project manager who created the new system, can stay involved. Being empathetic to the challenges of change management can help you support the process in subtle ways. In this case, participating in change management might mean communicating with employees throughout the project about how the system will provide a better experience for their customers. You support the process by providing employees with information so they feel prepared to adjust to changes once the system is ready to launch. Since participating in change management is such a big part of being a successful project manager, I want to take you through a few examples so you can see how this might play out in different types of organizations. You'll see how to combine your knowledge of organizational structure and culture to make decisions about planning for the change management process. Let's explore the same pharmacy check-in project in two different organizational structures and with different team cultures to understand how these ideas are applied. Say the pharmacy chain is a Classic organizational structure and has an informal corporate culture. The final project requires a name change from the old check-in system called "Speedy Care" to the new system called "Speedy Check-in." Getting this change implemented, is an example of change management. As the project manager, you need to participate in the change management process by communicating the project needs through the appropriate channels. In this case, the chief executive officer or CEO, sends an email to the C-suite, now these are all the chief level officers in an organization. The CEO lets them know that the name must be changed and to please inform their teams to implement the name change. Since this is a Classic structure within a hierarchical organization, the budgets are managed separately, and the marketing department needs to request an extra $10,000 to change all of their printed posters for the stores. This request goes back up to the Chief Financial Officer or CFO. There may be other cost adjustments and process changes that need to happen across the organization to ensure a successful system name change. In this instance, you may need to have multiple meetings with others to help them understand what is changing, and why. Now suppose that the pharmacy chain is a Matrix organization structure and has a formal corporate culture. What does change management look like in this scenario? Well, you might meet with representatives from marketing and technology to explain the overall budget impact for all the necessary changes. With the formal culture, you might write a document that describes all budget, timeline, and training impacted by the name change. Then you might circulate that document to get feedback and alignment from all the stakeholders and share that feedback with the CEO so they can understand the full scope of the name change. The feedback and alignment from the stakeholders will tell the CEO how the change management process went. Did everyone agree on the implications? Was the feedback positive, or was there resistance? Then, when the CEO needs to communicate the name change to the entire organization, she may have someone on her team write up a formal memo that describes why the name change needs to happen and share out the memo to her staff and their teams. Keep in mind these are just examples and every organization's structure, team culture, and change management processes are going to be different. But understanding this framework can help you navigate how to effectively participate in and support change management. This understanding can allow you to ask yourself questions that will inform change management, such as how will the organization react to change? Which influencers can affect change? What are the best means of communication? What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of my project and so on? The answers to these questions will help you prepare for a variety of possible scenarios, and craft solutions to effectively support the adoption of your project. They will also help you navigate possible challenges along the way and lead your project through a successful change management process. I know this is a lot, but you're doing a great job. We'll continue to talk about these concepts throughout the course. So no sweat if you're still processing all this new information. See you in a bit.



## Corporate and project governance - 20min 阅读资料

**Governance** in business is the management framework within which decisions are made and accountability and responsibility are determined. In simple terms, governance is understanding who is in charge. In this reading, we will discuss corporate governance and project governance. It is important to learn how corporate and project governance are related since you may have to speak about governance in an interview. Additionally, you will need to understand how your project relates to the governance structure of the organization.

**Corporate governance**

Each organization is governed by its own set of standards and practices that direct and control its actions. Those standards and practices are called **corporate governance**, and they will influence your projects. Corporate governance is the framework by which an organization achieves its goals and objectives. Corporate governance is also a way to balance the requirements of the various corporate entities, such as stakeholders, management, and customers. Corporate governance affects every part of an organization, including action plans, internal and external controls, and performance measurements.

Governance and change management go hand-in-hand. Think back to the previous videos on change management. To successfully implement change management, it is essential that you understand the structure and culture of the organization. Effective governance in change management provides clearly defined roles and responsibilities during change. This enables the people within the organization to have a precise understanding of who makes decisions and of the relationship between those managing and participating in the change management process. 

Another example of governance within an organization is the creation and use of **steering committees**. Steering committees decide on the priorities of an organization and manage the general course of its operations. The steering committee essentially acts as an advisory board or council to help the project manager and the company make and approve strategic decisions that affect both the company and the project. 

**Project governance**

As a project manager, you will be responsible for **project governance**. Project governance is the framework for how project decisions are made. Project governance helps keep projects running smoothly, on time, and within budget. Project governance involves all the key elements that make a project successful. It tells you what activities an organization does and who is responsible for those activities. Project governance covers policies, regulations, functions, processes, procedures, and responsibilities. 

**How project and corporate governance intersect**

Project governance needs to be tailored to your organization's specific needs. These needs will influence how you implement and monitor the governance framework on your project. Project governance concerns those areas of corporate governance that are specifically related to project activities. Effective project governance ensures that an organization’s projects are aligned to the organization’s larger objectives, are delivered efficiently, and are sustainable. This includes:

- Considering the long- and short-term interests of your organization
- Making thoughtful decisions about which projects to take on and avoiding projects if you do not have sufficient resources
- Providing timely, relevant, and reliable information to the board of directors and other major stakeholders 

- Eliciting the input and buy-in of senior managers since they are the decision-makers 
- During the initiation phase, prioritizing clear, reachable, and sustainable goals in order to reduce confusion and conflict
- During the planning phase, assigning ownership and accountability to an experienced team to deliver, monitor, and control the process 
- During the execution phase, learning from mistakes and adapting to new or improved knowledge

Corporate governance can involve clearing many hurdles before making decisions. These decisions can influence not only a single project, but the entire corporation. 

At the same time, corporate governance can help support project governance, as it provides oversight on compliance and mitigating risk and offers guidance and direction for project managers. Good corporate governance can also help project managers secure resources, get issues addressed, avoid delays in decision-making, get buy-in from stakeholders, and achieve visibility for projects on the executive level.

**Key takeaway**

You should think about an organization’s culture and structure when you are interviewing for a new role and as you begin a new role or project. You should consider an organization’s governance processes and practices in the same way. This will help you understand how decisions are made, who is responsible for what, and what are the potential issues and areas of concern.

## How to uncover job opportunities

Starting a new career means not only developing a new skill set but also learning how to relate your previous experience and skills to the new role you’re pursuing. If you’re ready to start your journey on a new career path, this reading will help you position yourself for success in your job search. You’ll learn how to understand what your potential employer is looking for and how to connect your background to their needs. The strategies outlined below are designed to help you become a strong job candidate, even if you don’t have directly relevant experience. 

The first step is to fully understand the role you’re targeting.



![A person looking at a computer screen](img/26.png)

**Understand your target role**

One of the primary challenges for anyone looking to launch a new career is how to stand out against candidates who already have experience in the field. Overcoming this challenge begins with developing a comprehensive understanding of the role you’re targeting. You'll need to understand the role in the context of any company you’re applying to, and more broadly as well. Having a holistic understanding of what it takes to succeed in your target role will help you determine your suitability for the role, and identify any steps you can take to improve your chances of getting hired.

To understand everything from minimum must-have requirements to skills that might help you stand out from the crowd, you can begin by researching and analyzing job descriptions across different organizations. 

Below you’ll find our recommended strategy for how to approach this process effectively.

**Analyze job listings**

The first part of the process is to gather information from multiple job listings:

- **Pull up ten job descriptions for your target role**. To do this, you can use job boards like Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn. Make sure the roles you select come from different companies, share similar titles, and are roles you would actually apply for. In each job description, you should be able to identify a section listing requirements for the role. 
- **Combine all the job requirements**. To do this, create a new Google document and copy over all the required responsibilities from all ten job descriptions. 
- **Order requirements based on appearance frequency.** Certain requirements will likely appear in multiple descriptions. The more commonly they appear, the more likely it is that they’re essential for the role. Put the most frequently appearing requirements at the top of your list. For example, a requirement that appears in all ten descriptions would go at the very top.

After completing these steps, you should have a clearer picture of which requirements are most common and important for the role. You may also have questions:

- **Why do requirements differ across job descriptions?** One of the most common reasons for this has to do with overly general job titles, or job titles that don’t necessarily communicate the specific scope of a given role at a particular company. For example, a program manager at one company might be focused on customer management, while at another company, the emphasis might be on project management. A Data Analyst might primarily use SQL at one company and Python at another. Because of these differences, it’s important to look beyond job titles. This is why we recommend the process outlined above—to help ensure you’re targeting the exact roles that are right for you—and that you understand the requirements for those exact roles.

- **Why are some requirements higher on my list than I thought they would be, while others I expected to see barely show up at all?** If you’re surprised by your results, you may need to spend more time learning what the role really entails, as you may have some preconceptions about the role that require adjusting. You might also need to do additional research to ensure you’re targeting the right roles in your job search. 

- **How do I know if I’m really right for my target role?** It’s perfectly normal to experience self-doubt at this stage of the process. Remember, this is a new career for you. You’re not expected to know everything about the role, and it’s likely that your existing skills and experience won’t line up perfectly. The more you learn about the role, the better you’ll understand what’s required for success, and the more you’ll know about how to prepare yourself for that success.

**Create your professional inventory**

For this next step, you can temporarily set aside the master list of role requirements you previously created. The focus here will be on your existing professional qualifications, and any other skills or experience you possess that might be relevant to your target role and of value to a potential employer. 

To begin, assemble a comprehensive list of the following:

- **Technical (hard) skills**. These are skills relating to a specific task or situation such as programming, technical writing, project management, and more.

- **Non-technical (interpersonal) skills.** These are the skills that enable people to navigate their environment, work well with others, perform well, and achieve their goals. They include skills like communication, leadership, team management, and more.

- **Personal qualities.** These are positive attributes and personality traits such as being honest, having a good sense of humor, and being dependable. You can also include your professional interests on this list.

- **Education.** This includes any post-secondary education, certifications, or independent classes completed online or offline.

**Tip**: You do not need to limit your professional inventory to skills and qualities developed through professional experience. Consider any volunteer, extracurricular, or personal experiences that might help a hiring manager understand your capabilities. 

Once you’ve created your inventory of skills and experience, you’re ready to line these up against your requirements list.

**Match your profile to the job requirements**

The concluding step in this process is to match your profile to the job requirements. The goal here is to make it easy for any hiring manager to see why you’re a great fit for their role. You’ll accomplish this by learning what to emphasize and focus on in your search, on your resume, and during interviews.

To begin, go through your professional inventory of skills and experience, highlighting each item in green, orange, or red, depending on its relevance to your target role. Relevance is determined by whether a given skill appears on your role requirements list, how high it appears on your list, and how directly it aligns with your list. 

For example, let’s say you’re interested in a program manager role. If you’re skilled at using project management software, and project management software skills are high on your job requirements list, then highlight that item in green. If you have some experience with tools that do not consistently show up on job descriptions but could still be relevant, highlight these skills in orange. 

- **Green** should be used for skills that are directly relevant to your target role. You should look for roles that emphasize these skills. You should also highlight these skills on your resume, and be prepared to discuss them in an interview.
- **Orange** should be used to identify those skills and experiences that are relevant for the role but not necessarily in a direct way. These are generally your transferable skills—skills that you bring with you from past experiences that can help you succeed in your new role. Plan to have to explain these to recruiters and hiring managers, as their relevance may not be immediately evident.
- **Red** should be used for items that are not relevant for your job search. De-prioritize these skills, and steer clear of highlighting them on your resume and focusing on them during interviews.

Of these three categories, the orange items are where you’ll need to focus extra attention. When it comes to transferable skills, you have to do the convincing, as you can’t count on a recruiter or hiring manager making the connection. For example, no job description for a project manager role calls for waitstaff experience. However, that project manager job description will likely mention excellent communication skills—which you would have developed during your hospitality career. When applying for the project manager role, make sure your resume specifically mentions excellent communication in addition to listing “waiter” or “waitress” as your previous occupation. Once you’ve categorized your skills and experience based on how well they align with the requirements for your target role, you’re ready to move your job search forward.
