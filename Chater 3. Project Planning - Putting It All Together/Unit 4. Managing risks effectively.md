# Understanding risk management

> 理解风险管理

## Introduction: Managing risks effectively

> 简介：有效地风险管理

Welcome back.

Earlier, we covered managing costs and a project budget.

We discussed what the components of a project budget are, how the budget process works, and how to track and estimate a budget.

You also learned about the procurement process.

Coming up, we will discuss risk management and why it's important to help prevent project failure.

Knowing how to anticipate-预期,预料 and alleviate-减轻,缓和, (commonly known as mitigate-减轻,缓和,缓解) the potential problems is your **best bet**-最佳选择 for keeping a project on track.

> 了解如何预测和缓解(通常称为缓和)潜在问题是保持项目正常进行的最佳选择。

You will learn how to define and relate risk management concepts and explain how risk management can help protect your project from-（使）免遭 failing.

> 您将学习如何定义和关联风险管理概念，并解释风险管理如何帮助保护您的项目免于失败。

You'll also identify risk types and how to measure-衡量 their impact on a project and communicate and resolve identified risks using a mitigation-减轻,缓和,缓解 plan.

Ready to get started?

Great. Meet me in the next video.



## The importance of risk management

> 风险管理的重要性

Think about a time in your life when you managed a project.

> 想想你一生中管理一个项目的经历。

Maybe it was a professional project, like creating an employee schedule, or a personal project, like planning a family celebration. 

> 也许这是一个专业项目，比如制定员工时间表，或者是个人项目，比如计划一个家庭庆祝活动。

Now ask yourself this: Did everything go according to plan?

> 现在问问你自己：一切都是按计划进行的吗?

If I had to guess-猜测,认为,以为, I would bet-打赌,预计,猜想 there was at least one hurdle-障碍,难关 you had to **deal with**-处理,应对.

> 如果要我猜的话，我打赌你至少要克服一个障碍。

That's because no project goes 100 percent according to plan, even-甚至,即使 when they're run by the most experienced project managers. 

> 这是因为没有一个项目是100%按计划进行的，即使是由最有经验的项目经理管理的项目。

Maybe you planned that employee schedule perfectly, and then someone caught a cold-感冒,伤风, forcing-强迫 you to rearrange-重新整理,重新布置 the schedule at the last minute.

> 也许你把员工的日程安排得很好，然后有人感冒了，迫使你在最后一刻重新安排日程。

Or maybe just as family members started arriving for that celebration, you realized you forgot to buy ice to keep the drinks cold. 

> 或者就在家人开始来参加庆祝活动的时候，你意识到你忘了买冰块来保持饮料的低温。

Hey, these things happen.

As we told you earlier, flexibility is an important skill for managing projects.

> 正如我们之前告诉您的，灵活性是管理项目的一项重要技能。

Due to the nature-性质 of the project and really-事实上 life in general-一般的, it's also important that you identify and plan for risks that could impact your project.

> 由于项目的性质和实际生活的一般情况，识别和计划可能影响项目的风险也很重要。

Let's discuss what a risk actually is.

> 我们来讨论一下风险到底是什么。

A risk is a potential event which can occur and can impact your project.

> 风险是可能发生并影响您的项目的潜在事件。

When you think about risk in the context of project management, you will think about them as hypothetical-假设的,假定的.

> 当你在项目管理的背景下考虑风险时，你会认为它们是假设的。

In other words, these aren't events that will definitely-肯定地,确定的 happen, but because there's a possibility that they could happen, it's your responsibility as the project manager to identify and plan for those risks.

> 换句话说，这些不是一定会发生的事件，但是因为它们有可能发生，所以作为项目经理，识别和计划这些风险是你的责任。

Next, let's discuss issues.

An issue is a known or real problem that can affect the ability to complete a task.

> 问题是可以影响完成任务的能力的已知或实际问题。

What's the difference between a risk and an issue?

Think of it like this: a risk is an event that could potentially happen.

If the event actually happens, then the risk becomes an issue.

> 如果事件真的发生了，那么风险就变成了一个问题。

In other words, risks are the big what-ifs and issues are things that currently-现时,当前 impact a project.

> 换句话说，风险是大的假设，问题是当前影响项目的事情。

It is clear that risks and issues can pose-造成,引起 a threat-威胁,恐吓 to your project.

> 很明显，风险和问题可能对您的项目构成威胁。

How you manage those risks is known as risk management.

> 你如何管理这些风险就是风险管理。

Risk management is the process of identifying and evaluating potential risks and issues that could impact a project.

> 风险管理是识别和评估可能影响项目的潜在风险和问题的过程。

It's not a one-time exercise; it's something that you'll need to do regularly to address potential risks.

> 这不是一次性的练习;这是你需要定期做的事情，以应对潜在的风险。

Risk management is a crucial part of the planning process by giving you an understanding of what could go wrong with your project.

> 风险管理是计划过程中至关重要的一部分，它使您了解项目可能出现的问题。

It also tells you who you need to consult about the risk.

> 它还会告诉你需要向谁咨询风险。

It helps you determine how the potential risk could be mitigated.

> 它可以帮助您确定如何减轻潜在风险。

This way, if or when something goes wrong, you'll have a plan prepared and ready to go.

> 这样，如果出现问题，你就会有一个准备好的计划，随时准备出发。

Part of being proactive-积极主动的 and planning ahead-提前 is identifying potential risks and how to solve for them.

> 积极主动和提前计划的一部分是识别潜在的风险以及如何解决它们。

This way, you'll set up your project with better chances for success.

> 这样，你的项目就有更大的成功机会。

Failing-未能做 to engage-参加,从事 in meaningful risk management can have a few big consequences-结果,后果 for your project.

> 未能参与有意义的风险管理可能会对您的项目产生一些重大后果。

First, if you don't plan ahead, you may put your project at risk of not meeting its project goal, its timelines, or success criteria.

> 首先，如果你不提前计划，你可能会把你的项目置于无法达到项目目标、时间线或成功标准的风险之中。

For example, if your goal is to publish a research report and your research analyst-分析者 quits-退出 halfway-在中间 through the project, you will likely miss the deadline if you don't have a backup plan ready to go.

> 例如，如果你的目标是发布一份研究报告，而你的研究分析师在项目中途退出，如果你没有准备好备用计划，你很可能会错过最后期限。

Additionally, by failing to plan for risks, you also fail to think through the many different ways that your project could pivot-转向 and still meet its goals.

> 此外，由于未能对风险进行计划，您也无法考虑到项目可以转向的许多不同方法，并且仍然可以实现其目标。

Even if an issue does arise, there often isn't just one way to meet your project goals and success can come in many forms.

> 即使出现了问题，通常也不是只有一种方法可以实现项目目标，成功可以以多种形式出现。

Risk management helps you determine how flexible or rigid-刚性,严格的 your plan is and then make necessary adjustments.

> 风险管理可以帮助您确定您的计划的灵活性或刚性，然后进行必要的调整。

For example, if your project requires a large product shipment-运输,运送, having a backup supplier ready means you could quickly pivot if a main supply is unable to fulfill your order.

> 例如，如果您的项目需要大量的产品运输，那么准备一个备用供应商意味着如果主要供应商无法满足您的订单，您可以快速转向。

Finally, risks can affect projects in a variety of ways that are difficult to foresee-预见,预知.

> 最后，风险会以各种难以预见的方式影响项目。

For example, a supplier you've hired may not have adequate-足够的,适当的 stock to cover your purchasing needs, or the budget for your project could be cut-削减 unexpectedly.

> 例如，你雇佣的供应商可能没有足够的库存来满足你的采购需求，或者你的项目预算可能会意外地被削减。

The risk management process helps reduce the impact of unexpected events, **freeing up**-释放,腾出 resources to focus on activities that benefit the project.

> 风险管理过程有助于减少意外事件的影响，将资源释放出来，专注于有利于项目的活动。

Let's imagine risk management in the context of Plant Pals at Office Green, which is a new service that will provide customers with small, low-maintenance desk plants.

> 让我们想象一下“绿色办公室植物伙伴”的风险管理，这是一项为客户提供小型、低维护的桌面植物的新服务。

One potential project risk is the possibility that the web page for the new service won't be live in time for the launch.

> 一个潜在的项目风险是，新服务的网页可能无法及时上线。

Another potential risk could be a fulfillment shortage-短缺,不足.

> 另一个潜在的风险可能是配送不足。

What would you do if the plant supplier runs low on the cacti and ferns that you need?

> 如果植物供应商没有你需要的仙人掌和蕨类植物，你该怎么办?

To prepare for these potential risks, you will need to think about ways to mitigate these issues before they happen, or how you will address these issues if they actually occur.

> 要为这些潜在的风险做好准备，您需要考虑在这些问题发生之前减轻它们的方法，或者如果它们真的发生了，您将如何处理这些问题。

Hopefully, these things won't be a problem, but if they are, you'll be prepared.

> 希望这些事情不会成为问题，但如果是，你要做好准备。

I also want to stress-强调 that issues will come up throughout the project you did not or could not have planned for, and that's okay. 

> 我还想强调，在整个项目中，你没有或无法计划的问题会出现，这没关系。

When these moments arise, it is important to keep calm-镇静的,沉着的, figure out the root cause of the problem, and come up with a solution. 

> 当这些时刻出现时，重要的是要保持冷静，找出问题的根本原因，并提出解决方案。

Risk management is a really important topic for project managers to understand.

> 风险管理是项目经理需要了解的一个非常重要的话题。

Identifying risks and issues prepares you for the unknown.

> 识别风险和问题为你应对未知做好了准备。

It also positively-乐观地,自信地 impacts you as the project manager because you'll feel more prepared, less stressed, and more confident-自信的,充满信心的 in your approach if an issue does occur.

> 作为项目经理，它也会对你产生积极的影响，因为当问题发生时，你会觉得自己准备得更充分，压力更小，对自己的方法更有信心。

Up next, we will discuss ways that you can identify risks.

I'll meet you there.



## Stanton: Managing my first project

> 斯坦顿:管理我的第一个项目

Hi, I'm Stanton, and I'm a program manager at YouTube.

Thinking back to one of the first projects I ever-曾经 worked on, we were actually in charge-责任 of building this sports highlight-集锦,重头戏 app.

> 回想一下我参与的第一个项目，我们实际上负责构建这个体育集锦应用程序。

But it wasn't just an app, it was an iOS app, it was an Android app, it was a website.

> 但它不仅仅是一个应用，它是一个iOS应用，它是一个Android应用，它是一个网站。

And I remember the very first meeting I went to, I was just furiously-疯狂地,猛烈地,狂暴地 taking down notes and trying to understand what the heck-糟糕,见鬼 was going on.

> 我记得我参加的第一次会议，我只是疯狂地记笔记，试图理解到底发生了什么。

And immediately after I thought-想法,看法: okay, this is my first project, I have to get all the details right.

> 我立刻想到:好吧，这是我的第一个项目，我必须把所有的细节都做好。

I have to make sure we know every little thing that was going to happen.

> 我得确保我们知道将要发生的每一件小事。

The launch date needed to be perfect-完美的,无暇的.

> 发布日期必须是完美的。

We had to get all the bugs down to zero.

> 我们得把所有的漏洞都消除。

I was just totally consumed with getting everything right the first time.

> 我只是一心想着第一次就把事情做好。

I think what I've realized since then is you're probably not going to get your first project plan correct because there's just so many things that can change.

> 我想从那以后我意识到的是，你可能不会把你的第一个项目计划做好，因为有太多的事情可能会改变。

You might find a bug last minute before launch.

> 你可能会在发布前最后一分钟发现一个bug。

Your client might come in and say they want different requirements like, "The screen-屏幕 needs to be blue instead of red."

> 你的客户可能会进来说他们想要不同的要求，比如，“屏幕需要是蓝色而不是红色。”

And then you find out that it's not really that easy to change from blue to red.

> 然后你会发现从蓝色变成红色并不是那么容易。

If I could go back and tell myself what to do at that point or what I could have done differently, I would have just told myself: don't worry so much—changes happen.

> 如果我能回到过去，告诉自己在那个时候应该做什么，或者我可以做些什么不同的事情，我只会告诉自己:不要担心太多——变化会发生。

It's how you react-反应,起化学反应 and respond-回应 to those changes that's more important.

> 更重要的是你如何应对这些变化。

I think one of the best compliments-赞扬,问候 I've gotten is, "Even throughout all this mess, you're cool, you're calm, and you're collected-镇静的." 

> 我认为我得到的最好的赞美之一是，“即使在所有这些混乱中，你很酷，你很冷静，你很镇定。”

You think through what are the issues that have happened, how do we resolve them, and you do your program management thing.

> 你想清楚发生了什么问题，我们如何解决它们，然后你做你的项目管理。

You're not always going to have the right answer the very first time; things can change at the last minute.

> 你不可能第一次就得到正确答案;事情可能在最后一刻发生变化。

If you're able to stay cool and calm, make sure you understand everything else that's going on on the project.

> 如果你能保持冷静，确保你了解项目中发生的所有事情。

All these years have taught me that, you can always reuse-再次使用,重复使用 some things.

> 这些年来教会了我，你总是可以重复使用一些东西。

You're always going to have to react to some things, but no matter what, try to think proactively, try to figure out what those issues are going to be, and you'll be the better for it.

> 你总是要对一些事情做出反应，但无论如何，试着积极思考，试着弄清楚这些问题会是什么，你会因此变得更好。



## Phases of risk management

> 风险管理的阶段

In a previous video, you learned that **risk management** is the process of identifying and evaluating potential risks and issues that could impact your project.

> 在之前的视频中，您了解了风险管理是识别和评估可能影响项目的潜在风险和问题的过程。

Risk management is an ongoing-持续存在的,进行中的 practice throughout the life cycle of your project.

> 风险管理是贯穿项目生命周期的持续实践。

It typically involves some variation of these five steps:

> 它通常包括以下五个步骤的一些变化:

1. Identify the risk.
2. Analyze the risk.
3. Evaluate the risk.
4. Treat-处理 the risk. 
5. Monitor and control the risk.

![5 Phases Icon: 1. Identify, 2. Analyze, 3. Evaluate, 4. Treat and 5. Monitor & Control the risk](img/15.png)

Let’s break these down:

1. **Identify the risk.** The first phase of the risk management process is to identify and define potential project risks with your team. **After all**-毕竟,终究, you can only manage risks if you know what they are. 

	> **识别风险**。风险管理过程的第一阶段是与团队一起识别和定义潜在的项目风险。毕竟，只有知道风险是什么，你才能管理风险。

2. **Analyze the risk**. After identifying the risks, determine their likelihood-可能,可能性 and potential impact to your project. Serious-严重的,危急的 risks with a high probability of occurring pose-造成,引起 the greatest threat-威胁,恐吓.

	> **分析风险**。在确定风险之后，确定它们的可能性和对项目的潜在影响。具有高发生概率的严重风险构成的最大威胁。

3. **Evaluate the risk**. Next, use the results of your risk analysis to determine which risks to prioritize.

	> **评估风险**。接下来，使用风险分析的结果来确定要优先处理哪些风险。

4. **Treat the risk**. During this phase, make a plan for how to treat and manage each risk. You might choose to ignore minor risks, but serious-严重的,危急的 risks need detailed mitigation-缓解 plans.

	> **对待风险**。在这个阶段，制定一个如何处理和管理每个风险的计划。您可以选择忽略较小的风险，但严重的风险需要详细的缓解计划。

5. **Monitor and control the risk.** Finally, assign team members to monitor, track, and mitigate risks if the need arises.

	> **监控和控制风险。**最后，如果需要，分配团队成员监视、跟踪和减轻风险。

In the upcoming videos and activities, you will learn about each of these phases in more detail and use tools and templates to navigate the risk management process. 

> 在接下来的视频和活动中，您将更详细地了解这些阶段，并使用工具和模板来导航风险管理流程。



## Uncover-揭露,发现 opportunities using risk management

> 利用风险管理发现机会

When you think about risks, it is likely that you automatically-自然地,不假思索地 think of potential negative-消极的,负面的 events.

> 当你想到风险时，你很可能会自动想到潜在的负面事件。

But when identifying risks, it is important to also consider the good things that could happen, which are considered **opportunities**.

> 但在识别风险时，重要的是也要考虑到可能发生的好事，也就是所谓的机遇。

An opportunity is a potential positive outcome of a risk.

> 机会是风险的潜在积极结果。

It is important to recognize opportunities and to **capitalize on**-利用 them as they appear so you can reach your project goals faster, more cheaply-便宜地,廉价地, or with less effort.

> 重要的是要认识到机会，并在它们出现时利用它们，这样您就可以更快、更便宜或更少地实现项目目标。

Some examples of opportunities include: 

- Completing a milestone ahead of schedule

	> 提前完成一个里程碑

- Discounted-打折 materials 

	> 打折的材料

- Availability of additional resources (people, investments-投资, equipment) 

	> 额外资源(人员、投资、设备)的可用性

![Woman looking through binoculars](img/16.png)

**How to recognize an opportunity**

An **opportunity** is a potential positive outcome that may bring additional value to a project.

> 机会是一种可能为项目带来额外价值的潜在积极结果。

You can use the same tools and techniques that you use in risk management—identify, analyze, evaluate, treat, and control—to add potential opportunities to your risk management plan.

> 您可以使用在风险管理中使用的相同工具和技术—识别、分析、评估、处理和控制—来为您的风险管理计划添加潜在的机会。

You need to know what to do if things go wrong, but you should also make plans to seize-抓住,捉住 opportunities.

> 你需要知道如果事情出了问题该怎么做，但你也应该制定计划抓住机会。

By using techniques such as brainstorming-头脑风暴 and drawing on project history or prior experience, you can identify potential opportunities and outline how you will take advantage-优势,有利条件 of them if they occur.

> 通过使用诸如头脑风暴和绘制项目历史或先前经验之类的技术，您可以识别潜在的机会，并概述如果它们出现，您将如何利用它们。

---

As a project manager, you should always be on the lookout-监视,警戒 for potential opportunities when developing your risk management plan.

> 作为一名项目经理，在制定风险管理计划时，你应该时刻关注潜在的机会。

# Identifying and assessing risks

> 识别和评估风险

## Tools to help identify risks

> 帮助识别风险的工具

Hello, and welcome back.

Hopefully, you're beginning to notice how important it is to plan for risks.

> 希望你已经开始注意到为风险做计划是多么的重要。

Even-甚至,即使 the simplest projects can carry-携带,带来 some kind of risks.

> 即使是最简单的项目也会带来某种风险。

Remember, those risks shouldn't deter-阻止,使打消念头,防止 you from pursuing-追求,致力于 the project's goals.

> 记住，这些风险不应该阻止你追求项目的目标。

The key is to be prepared.

> 关键是要做好准备。

Let's discuss tools and techniques you can use to identify risks, including brainstorming and risk assessment.

> 让我们讨论可以用来识别风险的工具和技术，包括头脑风暴和风险评估。

---

Brainstorming is one of the most effective techniques for identifying risks with the team because it allows groups to spontaneously-自发地,不由自主地 share ideas without judgment-判断,看法.

> 头脑风暴是识别团队风险的最有效技术之一，因为它允许团队在没有判断的情况下自发地分享想法。

As a project manager, you will be responsible for bringing a group of people together to imagine potential risks.

> 作为一名项目经理，你将负责召集一群人一起想象潜在的风险。

Have your RACI chart at the ready to **refer to**-参考 when you decide who to invite-邀请 to this meeting.

> 准备好RACI图表，作为决定邀请谁参加会议的参考。

Speaking from experience, the best team for this task is a diverse-不同的,各式各样的 one, which includes individuals from various roles, backgrounds, and experiences.

> 从我的经验来看，完成这项任务的最佳团队是一个多元化的团队，其中包括来自不同角色、背景和经验的人。

Diverse teams bring different perspectives, experiences, and skill sets, and this may help you to identify risks that you may not have thought of on your own. For example, one member of your team might have experience working on multiple projects, while another newer team member, might bring a fresh perspective from their previous experience on other teams. A great tool that you can use during brainstorming is called a cause-and-effect diagram, also sometimes known as a fishbone diagram. Cause-and-effect diagrams show the possible causes of an event or risk and are very useful at risk management. For example, in the diagram seen here, the effect listed is a supplier missing its deadlines. This is a risk to your project. On the left, you'll brainstorm potential causes that would lead to the effect, like poor delegation or a lack of tracking tools. In other words, cause-and-effect diagrams can help identify all the ways that things could go wrong by identifying a potential risk, known as the effect, and working backwards to consider the potential causes of that risk. By categorizing and breaking them down into further causes, you are able to identify areas that could lead to a potential problem, like exceeding your budget or allowing scope creep to impact your timeline. As a reminder, scope creep refers to changes, growth, and uncontrolled factors that affect the project's scope at any point after the project begins. During these brainstorming sessions, you might find that your list of potential risks is quite long, and that's okay. It is a reality you and your team cannot account for every single problem that can occur during your project. So how do you decide which risks to focus on? List the outcomes from the brainstorm in a risk register. A risk register is a table or chart that contains your list of risks. Next, you will adopt a risk assessment technique. Risk assessment is the stage of risk management where qualities of a risk are estimated or measured. By qualities, we're mainly referring to how likely the risk is to occur and its potential impact on a project. We'll come back to this point in a moment. There are a few ways to assess risks, but one we'll focus on is creating a probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a tool used to prioritize project risks. I personally love this technique and use it all the time in my role at Google. Earlier, I mentioned that you need to assess the likelihood that a risk will happen and its potential impact. This matrix will help you do just that. To create a probability and impact matrix, you will need to think about the level of impact. Impact refers to the damage a risk could cause if it occurs. Impact is also determined on a scale of high, medium, and low. High means that if the risk occurs, it will substantially alter the project. Low means if the risk occurs, it will have a slight impact but it's not likely to derail the project. You will also need to think about probability. Probability is the likelihood that a risk will occur. We also determine probability on a scale of high, medium, and low. In this case, high probability means there's a high likelihood of this happening. Low probability means you've identified a risk that could happen, but it isn't likely that the risk will occur. These two considerations come together to determine the inherent risk rating. Inherent risk is the measure of a risk calculated by its probability and impact. Measuring the inherent risk gives us a method for understanding a risk. Inherent risk is also determined on a high, medium, and low scale. Basically, if a risk has a low impact and low probability, it has a low inherent risk rating. These are the types of risks you don't need to worry too much about. But if a risk has a high impact and a high probability, then it carries a high inherent risk rating. Medium to high risks are the risks you should focus on and create detailed mitigation plans for. When you're creating a probability and impact matrix, it's important to ensure you create a matrix that meets accessibility guidelines and has information and formatting that everyone can easily and quickly understand. One way to do this is to use both color and distinct shapes or text to communicate levels of risk. You can learn more about accessibility communication by visiting course resources. The way you view and manage each risk will be determined based on your organization's risk appetite, which refers to the willingness of an organization to accept the possible outcomes of a risk. You, your team, and your stakeholders may have different appetites for each risk. We'll discuss how risk appetite plays into risk mitigation in just a bit. Certain low-level risks that could result in minor setbacks are much more tolerable than high-level risks that have the potential to completely derail your project. Once you've completed your risk assessment, you will update the risk register to include high, medium, and low ratings for some examples of risks that you've identified for this project. Great. Now that we've covered how to identify and assess risks, we'll go on to the next video, where we'll discuss some of the types of risks you'll run into during your role as a project manager. Meet you there.
