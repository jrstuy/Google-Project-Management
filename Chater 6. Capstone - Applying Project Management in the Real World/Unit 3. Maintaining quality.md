# Developing a quality management plan

> 制定质量管理计划

## Introduction: Maintaining quality

> 介绍：质量维护

Welcome back.

So far, you've completed a project charter and a project plan for the Sauce &amp; Spoon tablet roll out project.

> 到目前为止，您已经完成了 Sauce &amp; Spoon  的项目章程和项目计划平板电脑推出项目。

Coming up, we'll move from the planning phase of the project life cycle to the execution phase.

> 接下来，我们将从项目生命周期的计划阶段转到执行阶段。

But before you can begin executing, you'll need to make sure your project's quality management plan has been established so you know you're delivering a project that meets your stakeholders' expectations.

> 但是在你开始执行之前，你需要确保你的项目的质量管理计划已经建立，这样你就知道你交付的项目满足了涉众的期望。

In the upcoming videos and activities, you'll practice defining quality standards for your project.

> 在接下来的视频和活动中，你将练习为你的项目定义质量标准。

Then you'll evaluate how successfully the project's standards are being met and present your findings to stakeholders.

> 然后，您将评估项目的标准是否成功地得到满足，并将您的发现呈现给涉众。

You'll also create a retrospective document, which project managers use during discussions about project progress, and any process improvements that need to be made.

> 您还将创建一个回顾文档，项目经理在讨论项目进度和需要进行的任何过程改进时使用该文档。

Before we get started, let's review the project scenario for this course.

> 在我们开始之前，让我们回顾一下本课程的项目场景。

Sauce &amp; Spoon is a small but growing chain of restaurants with five locations.

> Sauce &amp; Spoon 是一家拥有五家分店的小型但正在成长中的连锁餐厅。

They've hired Peta as their first in-house project manager to launch the pilot of tablet menus at two of their locations.

> 他们已经聘请Peta作为他们的第一个内部项目经理，在他们的两个地点推出平板电脑菜单试点。

Over the next several videos, I'll share helpful information you can use to complete each activity and assessment, and I'll offer tips that you can take with you after you complete this course.

> 在接下来的几个视频中，我将分享有用的信息，你可以用它来完成每个活动和评估，我将提供小贴士，你可以带着你完成这门课程。

By the time we're done, you'll understand how to establish a list of quality standards for one aspect of the Sauce &amp; Spoon project. 

> 当我们完成时，您将了解如何为 Sauce &amp; Spoon 项目的一个方面建立质量标准列表。

You'll also practice writing evaluation questions and survey questions that will help you determine if the quality standards are being met.

> 你还将练习写评估问题和调查问题，这将帮助你确定是否达到了质量标准。

And finally, you'll learn how to improve the process along the way and create a retrospective document, which you'll be able to add to your portfolio-作品集,投资组合 of project management documents.

> 最后，您将学习如何在此过程中改进流程并创建回顾性文档，您将能够将其添加到您的项目管理文档组合中。

Ready to get started?

Meet me in the next video, where we'll get started on developing your quality management plan.

> 下个视频见，我们将开始制定质量管理计划。



## Key quality management concepts

> 关键质量管理概念

Hi again.

In this video, I'll review key quality management concepts and discuss in more detail the importance and purpose of maintaining project quality.

> 在本视频中，我将回顾关键的质量管理概念，并更详细地讨论维护项目质量的重要性和目的。

A crucial part of project planning and executing includes implementing a quality management plan and holding yourself to it throughout the project.

> 项目计划和执行的一个关键部分包括实施质量管理计划，并在整个项目中坚持执行。

Quality planning refers to the process that the project manager or the team establishes and follows for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project as a whole and how to satisfy-使满意,使满足 them.

> 质量计划是指项目经理或团队建立并遵循的过程，以确定和确定与整个项目相关的质量标准以及如何满足这些标准。

We can't just launch a project and assume everything will be okay.

> 我们不能只是启动一个项目，然后假设一切都会好起来。

That's why planning for quality with clearly-defined standards, processes, and methods of evaluation is important.

> 这就是为什么用明确定义的标准、过程和评估方法来规划质量是很重要的。

It helps keep you focused on whether or not the project is progressing successfully and alerts you to any adjustments that need to be made to keep the project on track.

> 它可以帮助你关注项目是否成功进行，并提醒你需要做出的任何调整，以保持项目在正轨上。

Remember, as a project manager, you're responsible for the planning and execution of the project, as well as for the successful completion of the project.

> 记住，作为项目经理，你要负责项目的计划和执行，以及项目的成功完成。

Quality planning works together with general project planning and aligns with the overall project process.

> 质量计划与总体项目计划一起工作，并与整个项目过程保持一致。

Project goals and success criteria for the Sauce and Spoon tablet project will focus the details of a quality management plan on quality standards, evaluation questions, and feedback surveys to ensure that the project is delivering on quality and producing a desired outcome.

> Sauce and Spoon 平板项目的项目目标和成功标准将把质量管理计划的细节集中在质量标准、评估问题和反馈调查上，以确保项目按照质量交付并产生期望的结果。

After this video, you'll practice project quality management by identifying quality standards for the Sauce and Spoon tablet pilot. 

> 本视频结束后，您将通过确定Sauce and Spoon 平板试点项目的质量标准来实践项目质量管理。

---

Let's get started.

There are many benefits of creating and maintaining quality management in a project.

> 在项目中创建和维护质量管理有很多好处。

Some of these benefits include delivering a quality product, decreasing overhead-开销, and increasing collaboration and ongoing reviews.

> 其中一些好处包括交付高质量的产品，减少开销，增加协作和持续审查。

Overhead is another word for costs.

> 管理费用是成本的另一种说法。

Quality management helps decrease overhead by reducing the amount of errors that would cost-需花费 the organization money to fix. 

> 质量管理通过减少需要组织花钱来修复的错误数量来帮助减少开销。

Quality management processes ensure that the team is always learning and providing feedback, which in turn ensures that the project is on track to achieve its intended-预期的,打算中的 outcome.

> 质量管理过程确保团队始终在学习并提供反馈，这反过来又确保项目在实现其预期结果的轨道上。

In earlier courses, we covered the main concepts of quality management.

> 在较早的课程中，我们涵盖了质量管理的主要概念。

I'll do a quick review here.

> 我在这里快速回顾一下。

The main concepts are quality planning, which I defined at the beginning of this video;

> 主要的概念是质量规划，我在视频开始时定义过;

quality standards, which are the requirements, specifications-规格,规范, or guidelines that could be used to ensure the materials, products, processes, and services are fit for achieving a desired outcome;

> 质量标准是用于确保材料、产品、过程和服务适合实现预期结果的要求、规范或指南;

quality assurance, or QA, which is a review process that evaluates whether your project is moving towards delivering a high-quality service or product;

> 质量保证，或QA，这是一个评估你的项目是否朝着提供高质量服务或产品的方向发展的审查过程;

and quality control, often known as QC.

> 质量控制，通常称为QC。

Quality control refers to the techniques that are used to ensure quality standards are maintained when a problem is identified. 

> 质量控制是指在发现问题时用于确保维持质量标准的技术。

Here we'll focus on building quality standards for the Sauce and Spoon project, but in many projects, all of these concepts get built into an overarching-首要的 quality management plan which documents all the information needed to effectively manage quality throughout the project life cycle.

> 在这里，我们将关注于为Sauce and Spoon项目构建质量标准，但是在许多项目中，所有这些概念都被构建到一个总体质量管理计划中，该计划记录了在整个项目生命周期中有效管理质量所需的所有信息。

The quality management plan defines the policies-政策,方针,原则, processes, and criteria-标准,准则 for project quality, as well as the roles and responsibilities for carrying them out.

> 质量管理计划定义了项目质量的政策、过程和标准，以及执行它们的角色和责任。

Again, there are lots of different ways to develop and track quality management for your project, but the benefits and main concepts that make up quality management remain the same.

> 同样，有许多不同的方法可以为您的项目开发和跟踪质量管理，但是组成质量管理的好处和主要概念是相同的。

---

Let's review.

Some of the benefits of quality management include delivering a quality product, decreasing overhead, and increasing collaboration and review, and the main concepts of quality management are quality planning, quality standards, quality assurance, or QA, and quality control, or QC.

> 质量管理的一些好处包括交付高质量的产品，减少开销，增加协作和审查，质量管理的主要概念是质量计划，质量标准，质量保证，或QA，和质量控制，或QC。

Understanding these benefits and concepts will help you ensure you deliver a project that meets your stakeholders' expectations. 

> 理解这些好处和概念将帮助您确保交付的项目满足涉众的期望。

Coming up, you'll apply your understanding of quality management to develop quality standards for the Sauce and Spoon tablet rollout.

> 接下来，你将运用你对质量管理的理解，为 Sauce and Spoon 平板的推出制定质量标准。

Meet me in the next video to learn how.

> 下个视频见，我们一起学习。



## Defining quality standards

> 定义质量标准

Hi there.

Now that we reviewed the benefits and main concepts of quality management, we'll explore what it means to define quality standards.

> 现在我们回顾了质量管理的好处和主要概念，我们将探讨定义质量标准的意义。

We'll also discuss how to evaluate those standards to ensure you're meeting the project's goals.

> 我们还将讨论如何评估这些标准，以确保您满足项目的目标。

Before we get into discussing quality standards, let's define what we mean by project quality.

> 在讨论质量标准之前，让我们先定义一下项目质量是什么意思。

Quality means making sure that you deliver what you say you will and that you do so as efficiently as you can.

> 质量意味着确保你能做到你所说的，并且尽可能高效地做到这一点。

Getting a project done on time and under budget doesn't necessarily-必定,必然 mean you've met your goals; you need to be sure you've delivered a project that meets your stakeholders' needs.

> 在预算内按时完成一个项目并不一定意味着你达到了你的目标;你需要确保你已经交付了一个满足涉众需求的项目。

That's why project quality is tracked throughout the life cycle of the project.

> 这就是为什么在项目的整个生命周期中都要跟踪项目质量的原因。

You can measure project quality by defining quality standards for the various aspects of the project, like major tasks, milestones, and deliverables.

> 您可以通过为项目的各个方面定义质量标准来度量项目质量，比如主要任务、里程碑和可交付成果。

Quality standards are the requirements and specifications that your product or service must meet in order to be considered successful by your organization and the customer.

> 质量标准是你的产品或服务必须满足的要求和规范，以便被你的组织和客户认为是成功的。

Establishing standards helps you identify ways of testing and evaluating the project's quality throughout the planning and execution phases and after the project is launched.

> 建立标准可以帮助您确定在整个计划和执行阶段以及项目启动后测试和评估项目质量的方法。

If the quality of different aspects of a project is failing to meet the agreed-upon standards, you then have the opportunity to adjust your project plan to meet those standards.

> 如果项目的不同方面的质量未能达到商定的标准，那么您就有机会调整项目计划以满足这些标准。

Let's use an example from the Sauce & Spoon project.

> 让我们使用 Sauce & Spoon 项目中的一个例子。

One of the deliverables is training of management, front of house staff, and back of house staff.

> 其中一个可交付成果是对管理层、前台员工和后台员工的培训。

How will you know if that deliverable has been fulfilled successfully?

> 您如何知道交付成果是否已经成功完成?

What are the expectations or standards your stakeholders have for meeting this requirement?

> 您的涉众对满足这一需求的期望或标准是什么?

For this deliverable, think about what the staff needs to be able to do or demonstrate at the end of the training.

> 对于这个可交付成果，考虑一下员工在培训结束时需要能够做什么或演示什么。

Does each staff group need to be trained on the same things?

> 每个员工组都需要接受相同内容的培训吗?

Will management have different training requirements for front of house and back of house staff?

> 管理层对前台和后台员工有不同的培训要求吗?

Does the training need to fit within a specific time frame, budget, or geographic-地理的,地理学的 location to be considered successful?

> 培训是否需要符合特定的时间框架、预算或地理位置才能被认为是成功的?

Your answers to questions like these will be the start of your list of quality standards for this deliverable.

> 您对这些问题的回答将是您对此交付物的质量标准列表的开始。

There are lots of resources that can help you determine the standards for your project, and standards will look different depending on the type of project.

> 有很多资源可以帮助您确定项目的标准，并且根据项目的类型，标准看起来会有所不同。

The first resources to consult are project documents like the business case and project charter.

> 首先要参考的资源是项目文档，如业务案例和项目章程。

These documents state the goals, scope, budget, and other details that can clarify-澄清 the different requirements of the project so it's acceptable to your stakeholders.

> 这些文件陈述了目标、范围、预算和其他细节，这些细节可以澄清项目的不同需求，以便您的涉众可以接受。

Just like you did when you identified tasks and time estimates, if you need more information to help you determine quality standards, you can have conversations with experts and stakeholders and you can do some industry research.

> 就像你在确定任务和时间估计时所做的那样，如果你需要更多的信息来帮助你确定质量标准，你可以与专家和利益相关者进行对话，你可以做一些行业研究。

For example, if you need to know how long it takes the tablets to recharge-再充电, ask the vendor who will be training the staff or the tablet sales representative-代表.

> 例如，如果您需要知道平板电脑充电需要多长时间，请询问将培训员工的供应商或平板电脑销售代表。

It's also a good idea to have conversations with the stakeholders who are funding the project to understand their perspective on how long they expect the tablets to last before needing to be replaced.

> 与资助项目的利益相关者进行对话也是一个好主意，了解他们对平板电脑在需要更换之前的使用时间的看法。

Do industry research on the internet to see if there are established-既定 quality standards for the type of project that you're working on.

> 在互联网上做一些行业调查，看看你所从事的项目类型是否有既定的质量标准。

For example, software and construction industries have established quality standards related to functionality-功能, design, and safety. 

> 例如，软件和建筑行业已经建立了与功能、设计和安全相关的质量标准。

Other categories of established quality standards that you'll find in many industries include ease-容易 of use, productivity-生产率,生产力, effectiveness, and customer satisfaction.

> 您将在许多行业中发现的其他已建立的质量标准类别包括易用性、生产力有效性和客户满意度。

It's important that your standards are objective-客观的 and measurable so you can clearly identify that the standard has been met.

> 重要的是，你的标准是客观的和可衡量的，这样你就可以清楚地确定标准已经达到了。

As you have conversations and conduct your research, you might notice stakeholders referring to a general category, like ease of use, without providing specifics. 

> 当你进行对话和进行研究时，你可能会注意到利益相关者提到了一个一般的类别，比如易用性，而没有提供细节。

As the project manager, you should aim to get specific details by asking, "What would be a sign that the tablets are easy to use or hard to use?" You might get a response like, "It shouldn't take longer than 20 seconds to place an order," or "Returning customers report that it's faster to use the tablet versus placing an order with a server."

> 作为项目经理，你应该通过询问“平板电脑容易使用或难以使用的标志是什么?”来获得具体细节。你可能会得到这样的回应，“下订单的时间不应该超过20秒”，或者“回头客报告说，使用平板电脑比使用服务器下订单更快。”

---

Now you have objective, measurable standards.

> 现在你有了客观的、可衡量的标准。

Let's consider a few questions to ask yourself when considering various standards.

> 让我们考虑一下在考虑各种标准时要问自己的几个问题。

If standards are related to productivity and effectiveness, you might want to ask questions like, "Should the existence of the tablets change anything about how the front of house staff works? Does it make them faster or allow them to serve more tables at one time?"

> 如果标准与生产力和效率有关，你可能想问这样的问题:“平板电脑的存在是否会改变前台工作人员的工作方式?”这是让他们更快还是让他们一次服务更多的桌子?”

If standards are related to customer satisfaction, you could ask questions like, "How would the tablets ideally impact the customer's experience? What would you want the customer to do or say as a result of using the tablets?"

> 如果标准与客户满意度有关，你可以问这样的问题:“平板电脑理想地如何影响客户体验?”你希望客户在使用平板电脑后做些什么或说些什么?”

By asking yourself or your task experts these kinds of questions, you can **narrow down**-缩小范围 the standard that you're aiming to make objective and measurable.

> 通过问你自己或你的任务专家这些问题，你可以缩小你的目标是客观和可衡量的标准。

All of these resources, such as project documents, conversations with experts, and industry research, can help you determine the quality standards for different aspects of your project.

> 所有这些资源，例如项目文档、与专家的对话以及行业研究，都可以帮助您确定项目不同方面的质量标准。

But remember, you'll still need to use your critical-批判的 thinking skills to determine the right standards and adjust them, if necessary, to meet the specific needs of your project.

> 但请记住，您仍然需要使用批判性思维技能来确定正确的标准，并在必要时对其进行调整，以满足项目的特定需求。

---

Let's review what we've discussed so far.

> 让我们回顾一下到目前为止讨论的内容。

Quality means making sure that you deliver what you say you will and that you do so as efficiently as you can.

> 质量意味着确保你能做到你所说的，并且尽可能高效地做到这一点。

Quality standards are the requirements and specifications-规格 that your product or service must meet in order to be considered successful by your organization and the customer.

> 质量标准是你的产品或服务必须满足的要求和规范，以便被你的组织和客户认为是成功的。

There are lots of resources that can help you determine the standards for your project, including project documents like the business case and charter, conversations with experts and stakeholders, and industry research.

> 有很多资源可以帮助您确定项目的标准，包括项目文档，如业务案例和章程，与专家和涉众的对话，以及行业研究。

Some common categories of established-既定 quality standards from various industries include functionality, design, safety, ease of use, productivity, and effectiveness.

> 来自不同行业的已建立的质量标准的一些常见类别包括功能、设计、安全、易用性、生产力和有效性。

Finally, it's important that your standards are objective and measurable so you can clearly identify that the standard has been met.

> 最后，重要的是你的标准是客观的和可衡量的，这样你就可以清楚地确定标准已经达到了。

Coming up, you'll use your critical thinking skills to determine quality standards for one part of the Sauce & Spoon tablet project. 

> 接下来，你将使用你的批判性思维技能来确定 Sauce & Spoon 平板电脑项目的一部分的质量标准。

Then you'll learn how to evaluate against your standards to ensure that your project is achieving the required level of quality. 

> 然后，您将学习如何根据您的标准进行评估，以确保您的项目达到所需的质量水平。

Meet you there.

> 在那里见你。



# Evaluating quality standards

> 评价质量标准

## Creating evaluation questions

> 创建评估问题

Hi again.

In the last video, we reviewed the main concepts of quality management and defining quality standards for a project.

> 在上一个视频中，我们回顾了质量管理的主要概念和为项目定义质量标准。

Then, after analyzing project documentation and a conversation between Peta and stakeholders, you helped solidify-变可靠,变稳固 a list of quality standards for one of Sauce & Spoon's project deliverables.

> 然后，在分析项目文档和Peta与利益相关者之间的对话之后，您帮助巩固了 Sauce & Spoon 项目可交付成果的质量标准列表。

Once the quality management plan is underway-在进行中的 with clearly-defined quality standards, you're ready to measure against your standards and can finally begin implementing the project.

> 一旦质量管理计划以明确定义的质量标准进行，您就可以根据您的标准进行度量，并最终开始实施项目。

Since-自…以来 the last activity, Peta and her team have begun implementing the tablet rollout.

> 自从上次活动以来，佩塔和她的团队已经开始实施平板电脑的推出。

Both of the restaurants that were selected for the pilot have had tables outfitted-配备 with tablets.

> 被选为试点的两家餐厅都有配备平板电脑的桌子。

The staff has been trained and guests have been placing their orders using the new tablets.

> 工作人员已经接受了培训，客人们已经开始使用新的平板电脑下单。

---

In this video, we'll discuss the importance of evaluation as it relates to the project's quality management plan, specifically quality assurance.

> 在这个视频中，我们将讨论评估的重要性，因为它涉及到项目的质量管理计划，特别是质量保证。

Remember, quality assurance consists of reviewing processes to evaluate whether or not your project is delivering an acceptable level of quality.

> 记住，质量保证包括审查过程，以评估您的项目是否交付了可接受的质量水平。

And evaluation involves observing, measuring, and then comparing your findings to a set of agreed upon criteria.

> 评估包括观察、测量，然后将你的发现与一套商定的标准进行比较。

This could be your quality standards or the overall goals of your project.

> 这可能是您的质量标准或项目的总体目标。

---

Coming up, you'll create evaluation questions as part of the QA process so that you can measure how well your project is meeting the established-既定 quality standards.

> 接下来，你将创建评估问题作为QA过程的一部分，这样你就可以衡量你的项目是否符合既定的质量标准。

Understanding-理解,了解 how to create strong evaluation questions will give you the tools and skills you need to measure the success of your project throughout the project life cycle.

> 了解如何创建强有力的评估问题将为您提供在整个项目生命周期中衡量项目成功所需的工具和技能。

---

Let's get started.

In the same way that quality management plans may look different for each project, quality assurance could be implemented in a variety-多样化,种类 of ways.

> 同样的，质量管理计划对于每个项目可能看起来不同，质量保证可以以多种方式实现。

Some examples of quality assurance are beta testing, internal checklists, and feedback surveys.

> 质量保证的一些例子是beta测试、内部检查表和反馈调查。

Each of these methods allow you to evaluate and measure how well your project is meeting its goals.

> 每一种方法都允许您评估和度量您的项目实现其目标的程度。

Evaluation is a form of research designed to promote learning and inform decisions.

> 评估是一种研究形式，旨在促进学习和为决策提供信息。

It also provides accountability and helps you assess to what extent-程度,范围 the project has achieved its objectives.

> 它还提供了责任，并帮助您评估项目在多大程度上实现了其目标。

When you use evaluation, you're able to improve upon-在…上, judge, and learn about different aspects of the project and the project itself.

> 当您使用评估时，您能够改进、判断并了解项目和项目本身的不同方面。

For example, with the Sauce & Spoon project, evaluation can help you improve how to implement the staff training process more efficiently.

> 例如，在 Sauce & Spoon 项目中，评估可以帮助您改进如何更有效地实施员工培训流程。

It might help you judge or assess whether something is working the way it was intended-预期的 or whether you should continue in the same direction.

> 它可以帮助你判断或评估事情是否按照预期的方式进行，或者你是否应该继续往同一个方向发展。

It could be that the staff had a hard time learning how to use the tablets because the touch screens kept-保持,处于 malfunctioning-故障,失灵, in which case you'd need to assess whether or not to continue with the original launch date.

> 也有可能是因为员工很难学会如何使用平板电脑，因为触摸屏总是出现故障，在这种情况下，你需要评估是否要继续原定的发布日期。

You also need to make sure that the project is not creating any unintended-无意识的,非计划中的 problems, either for the organization, your team, or anyone else impacted by the projects existence.

> 您还需要确保项目不会产生任何意想不到的问题，无论是对组织、您的团队，还是受项目存在影响的任何人。

For example, you'll need to assess when the best time for tablet installation is.

> 例如，你需要评估安装平板电脑的最佳时机。

If you schedule tablet installation when the restaurant is open, that might create a negative dining experience for restaurant guests.

> 如果你把平板电脑的安装时间安排在餐厅营业的时候，这可能会给餐厅的客人带来负面的用餐体验。

By reflecting on areas of improvement and judging how certain aspects of the project performed, you learn what things made the project run as intended, how it can be replicated-重复,复制, and how challenges could be overcome-克服,解决 in the future.

> 通过反思改进的领域并判断项目的某些方面是如何执行的，您可以了解哪些事情使项目按预期运行，如何复制它，以及如何在未来克服挑战。

Your evaluation may have a single focus, like identifying what needs to be improved or judging whether a project or process should continue in its current format.

> 你的评估可能有一个单一的焦点，比如确定需要改进的地方，或者判断一个项目或过程是否应该以目前的形式继续下去。

Regardless of your goals, your evaluation will ultimately allow you to assess all three of these areas of improvement and lead you to a better understanding of the overall success of the project, as well as its impact on and benefit to the organization.

> 无论您的目标是什么，您的评估最终将允许您评估所有这三个改进领域，并使您更好地理解项目的整体成功，以及它对组织的影响和利益。

---

Okay, so now that we know why evaluation is used in project management, let's get into the evaluation process so that you know how to carry out an evaluation and get the information you need.

> 好了，既然我们知道了评估为什么会在项目管理中使用，让我们进入评估过程，这样你就知道如何进行评估并获得你需要的信息。

In order to identify what you really want to know about your project, first articulate-明确表达,清楚说明 why you're evaluating.

> 为了确定你真正想知道的关于你的项目，首先阐明你为什么要评估。

Understanding your "why" will shape-影响,形成 the types of questions you ask about your project.

> 理解你的“为什么”会影响你问项目问题的类型。

This goes back to improving, judging, and learning.

> 这又回到了改进、判断和学习。

Even though all three of these will be addressed to some degree, certain aspects will have a more specific focus for evaluation. 

> 尽管所有这三个方面都将在某种程度上得到解决，但某些方面将有更具体的评估重点。

You can **narrow down**-缩小范围 what to focus on by reviewing both the project goals and organizational goals and determining how the aspect you're evaluating connects to one of these goals.

> 您可以通过审查项目目标和组织目标，并确定您正在评估的方面如何与这些目标之一联系起来，从而缩小关注的范围。

---

Let's discuss an example.

> 让我们讨论一个例子。

The Sauce & Spoon project has just reached one of its last milestones—the completion of three key deliverables that are required for project launch testing.

> Sauce & Spoon 项目刚刚达到了最后一个里程碑——完成了项目启动测试所需的三个关键交付物。

Those deliverables are: installing the tablets, integrating the tablets with the POS system, and training the staff to use the tablets. 

> 交付成果包括:安装平板电脑，将平板电脑与POS系统集成，培训员工使用平板电脑。

In an upcoming meeting with stakeholders, Peta will need to provide an update on the project's progress and share an evaluation of this milestone.

> 在即将举行的与利益相关者的会议上，Peta 需要提供项目进展的最新情况，并分享对这一里程碑的评估。

It's important for Peta to share this evaluation since it will inform stakeholders on future phases of the project and beyond, including a tablet rollout at two more restaurant locations.

> 对 Peta 来说，分享这一评估非常重要，因为它将为项目的未来阶段及以后的利益相关者提供信息，包括在另外两家餐厅推出平板电脑。

So Peta's "why" is judging the quality and performance of the tablets and identifying ways to improve the training process.

> 因此，Peta的“为什么”是判断平板电脑的质量和性能，并找出改进训练过程的方法。

Once you've decided what your reasons for evaluating are, you're ready to write out your evaluation questions.

> 一旦你确定了评估的理由，你就可以写出你的评估问题了。

An evaluation question is a key question about the outcomes, impact, and/or effectiveness-有效性,效力 of your project or program.

> 评估问题是关于项目或计划的结果、影响和/或有效性的关键问题。

There are two main categories of evaluation questions: questions that ask how you can make improvements and questions that help you measure and compare.

> 评估问题主要有两类:问你如何改进的问题和帮助你衡量和比较的问题。

Questions that help you improve sound like this: How can we improve?

> 帮助你提高的问题听起来像这样:我们如何才能提高?

What is working and what's not working?

> 什么是有效的，什么是无效的?

Which goals are being met?

> 哪些目标正在实现?

Who is benefiting?

> 谁从中受益?

What are the most common participant reactions-反应,回应?

> 参与者最常见的反应是什么?

Next, we have questions that measure and compare.

> 接下来，我们有一些衡量和比较的问题。

These questions will help you make judgments about how or whether to proceed-继续进行 with the process or with the project itself. 

> 这些问题将帮助您对如何或是否继续进行流程或项目本身做出判断。

Questions for measuring and comparing sound like this: What were the results?

> 测量和比较的问题听起来像这样:结果是什么?

Were there unintended outcomes?

> 是否有意想不到的结果?

What were the costs and benefits?

> 成本和收益是什么?

Are there any lessons to be learned?

> 我们从中吸取了什么教训吗?

Should we continue?

> 我们应该继续吗?

So if we think back to the Sauce & Spoon project, one of the evaluation questions might be: To what extent-程度,范围 do tablets improve the staff's work performance?

> 因此，如果我们回想一下Sauce & Spoon项目，其中一个评估问题可能是:平板电脑在多大程度上提高了员工的工作绩效?

If you keep in mind the overall goals of the project, you'll be able to write effective questions that generate the type of data you want.

> 如果您牢记项目的总体目标，您将能够编写有效的问题，生成您想要的数据类型。

Effective evaluation questions meet the following criteria: They address stakeholder or user values, interests, and concerns-关注点; they relate to the purpose of the project and of evaluation, they're worth answering and are important for the project and beyond-除……之外,超出（范围）; and they're practical-真实的,实际的 and feasible-可行的,办得到的 to answer with available resources.

> 有效的评估问题满足以下标准:它们处理涉众或用户的价值、兴趣和关注点;这些问题与项目和评估的目的有关，值得回答，对项目和其他方面都很重要;用现有的资源来回答这些问题是实际可行的。

Amazing job!

Let's review some of what we've learned so far.

> 让我们复习一下到目前为止学过的东西。

Evaluation is a form of research designed to promote learning and informed decisions.

> 评价是一种研究形式，旨在促进学习和知情决策。

It also provides accountability.

> 它还提供了问责制。

An evaluation question is a key question about the outcomes, impact, and/or effectiveness of your project or a key aspect of your project.

> 评估问题是关于项目的结果、影响和/或有效性或项目的关键方面的关键问题。

And there are two main categories of evaluation questions—those that ask how to make improvements and those that help you measure and compare.

> 评估问题主要有两类，一类是询问如何改进的，另一类是帮助你衡量和比较的。

In the next video, I'll discuss how to create evaluation indicators-标志 for your questions, which will help you focus the type of feedback that will be most useful to your project.

> 在下一个视频中，我将讨论如何为您的问题创建评估指标，这将帮助您关注对您的项目最有用的反馈类型。

You'll apply what you've learned in upcoming activities as you review the supporting materials and write your own set of evaluation questions and indicators.

> 当你回顾支持材料并编写自己的一套评估问题和指标时，你将把你所学到的应用到即将到来的活动中。

Meet you there.



## Determining evaluation indicators

> 确定评价指标

Welcome back.

In the last video, we discussed the importance of evaluation and how to **come up**-提出,想出 with effective evaluation questions that address certain aspects and outcomes of your project.

> 在上一个视频中，我们讨论了评估的重要性，以及如何提出有效的评估问题，以解决项目的某些方面和结果。

---

In this video, I'll discuss how to determine evaluation indicators.

> 在本视频中，我将讨论如何确定评估指标。

Evaluation indicators reveal-揭示,透露 the specific type of data that needs to be collected to help you answer your evaluation questions.

> 评估指标揭示了需要收集的特定类型的数据，以帮助您回答评估问题。

In the next activity, you'll identify evaluation indicators for each of your evaluation questions and add them to the Sauce and Spoon quality management plan.

> 在下一个活动中，您将为每个评估问题确定评估指标，并将它们添加到酱勺质量管理计划中。

**Simply put**-简单来说, indicators state what you want to measure or evaluate, like the number of something, level of satisfaction, preferences, or demographic-人口的,人口统计的 information such as age, gender, experience, and so on.

> 简单地说，指示符陈述了您想要度量或评估的内容，例如某物的数量、满意度、偏好或年龄、性别、经验等人口统计信息。

Similar to the way quality standards add specificity to your deliverables and goals, evaluation indicators take your evaluation question and determine the specific type of response you're aiming-瞄准 for.

> 与质量标准为您的可交付成果和目标添加特异性的方式类似，评估指示将您的评估问题用于确定您所瞄准的特定类型的响应。

You'll need this information to understand whether or not your project or process meets the quality standards that were agreed upon in the project plan.

> 您将需要这些信息来了解您的项目或过程是否符合项目计划中商定的质量标准。

Let's return to the Sauce and Spoon project and the evaluation question which asks, "To what extent do tablets improve the staff's work performance?"

> 让我们回到 Sauce and Spoon 项目和评估问题，“平板电脑在多大程度上提高了员工的工作绩效?”

To evaluate this, you'll have to ask yourself, "How are you going to measure work performance?"

> 为了评估这一点，你必须问自己，“你将如何衡量工作表现?”

You'll have to decide on indicators of work performance like faster table turnover rates, higher tip-小费 averages, or higher quality rating-评价,评定 from customers.

> 你必须决定工作表现的指标，比如更快的桌子流动率，更高的平均小费，或者更高的顾客质量评价。

---

Another way to think of indicators is that they provide pathways-途径,路径 for answering your evaluation questions.

> 考虑指标的另一种方式是，它们为回答评估问题提供了途径。

Indicators demonstrate that the outcomes are achieved and provide measurable evidence-根据,证明,证据 of meeting a goal.

> 指标表明取得了成果，并提供了实现目标的可衡量证据。

They also include visible signs-迹象 like test-测试,考试 scores, attendance-出席,出勤 rates, or observed behavior.

> 它们还包括考试成绩、出勤率或观察到的行为等可见迹象。

The word indicate means point out or show.

> 这个词的意思是指出或显示。

Evaluation indicators point out or show the way to answer the evaluation question.

> 评价指标指出或显示回答评价问题的方法。

This could include visible signs of how the staff works with the new tablets.

> 这可能包括员工如何使用新平板电脑的可见迹象。

Observed behavior such as fewer staff members congregating-集合,聚集 by the beverage-饮料 station or arriving late to work could be an indicator of increased productivity or over 90 percent staff compliance-服从,遵守 with the tablet-ordering process could be an indicator of **order placement**-订单下单 accuracy.

> 观察到的行为，比如在饮料站聚集的员工更少，或者上班迟到，可能是生产率提高的一个指标，或者超过90%的员工遵守平板电脑订购流程，可能是下单准确性的一个指标。

---

Awesome.

Let's review.

Evaluation indicators determine what data needs to be collected that will help you answer your evaluation questions.

> 评估指标决定了需要收集哪些数据来帮助您回答评估问题。

This includes clues-线索,提示, signs, or markers-标识,标志 that measure one aspect of a project and demonstrate how close that aspect is to meeting the quality standards that have been established.

> 这包括线索、标志或标记，它们测量项目的一个方面，并演示该方面离满足已建立的质量标准有多近。

In the next activity, you'll add evaluation indicators for each of the evaluation questions you added to the Sauce and Spoon quality management plan.

> 在下一个活动中，您将为您添加到 Sauce and Spoon 质量管理计划中的每个评估问题添加评估指标。

When you're done, meet me in the next video to get started on developing survey questions.

> 当你完成后，在下一个视频中与我见面，开始开发调查问题。



## Developing a survey

> 开展调查

Welcome back.

By now, you should have created a list of evaluation questions related to your quality standards for the Sauce & Spoon tablet roll out project and added evaluation indicators for each question.

> 到目前为止，您应该已经创建了一个与 Sauce & Spoon 平板电脑推出项目的质量标准相关的评估问题列表，并为每个问题添加了评估指标。

In this video, we'll discuss the survey development process, and I'll explain how a survey question is different from an evaluation question.

> 在这个视频中，我们将讨论调查的开发过程，我将解释调查问题与评估问题的区别。

---

Surveys are one of the tools that project managers use to get answers for their evaluation questions.

> 调查是项目经理用来获得评估问题答案的工具之一。

There are lots of methods for collecting data, and surveys are a popular method in project management.

> 收集数据的方法有很多，调查是项目管理中常用的一种方法。

In a survey, each respondent-调查对象 answers a set of clearly-defined questions, and the data are collected and analyzed.

> 在一项调查中，每个受访者回答一组明确定义的问题，并收集和分析数据。

This data could be used to demonstrate specific examples of the evaluation indicators you identified for your project.

> 此数据可用于演示您为项目确定的评估指标的具体示例。

For the tablet rollout, Peta has decided to create customer surveys as a way to get answers to the project's evaluation questions. 

> 为了推出平板电脑，Peta 决定创建客户调查，作为获得项目评估问题答案的一种方式。

So in an upcoming activity, you'll write a set of survey questions and add them to your quality management plan.

> 因此，在即将到来的活动中，您将编写一组调查问题并将其添加到您的质量管理计划中。

Being able to develop a survey and write survey questions is important because it demonstrates your ability to understand the goals of your project and assess how your stakeholders and users value the project.

> 能够开发调查并编写调查问题是很重要的，因为它展示了您理解项目目标以及评估涉众和用户如何评价项目的能力。

This helps you determine if you're achieving your quality goals and where you need to make adjustments.

> 这可以帮助您确定是否实现了质量目标，以及需要在哪些地方进行调整。

---

Let's start with a brief review of surveys.

> 让我们先简单回顾一下调查。

Surveys are tools you can use to evaluate and measure the quality of a project's process, goal, or deliverable.

> 调查是您可以用来评估和度量项目过程、目标或可交付成果质量的工具。

Making surveys a part of your quality management plan is one way to help you understand what's working and what's not working.

> 将调查作为质量管理计划的一部分是帮助您了解哪些工作有效哪些工作不有效的一种方法。

Surveys assess the criteria you want to evaluate and provide you with data that will point out whether you've met your quality standards.

> 调查评估你想要评估的标准，并为你提供数据，指出你是否达到了你的质量标准。

Designing an effective survey that will deliver the data you want is a skill and follows a strategic development-发育 process.

> 设计一份能提供你想要的数据的有效调查是一项技能，并遵循一个战略发展过程。

First, you'll need to develop evaluation questions and define your evaluation indicators, which you've already done.

> 首先，您需要开发评估问题并定义您的评估指标，这些您已经完成了。

Then you can determine what type of survey to design and questions to ask that will give you the data you need to answer your evaluation questions.

> 然后你可以决定设计哪种类型的调查，问什么问题，这将为你提供回答评估问题所需的数据。

Since you've already come up with your evaluation questions and indicators, the next step is to determine what types of survey questions you're going to ask as a reminder-提醒.

> 既然你已经提出了你的评估问题和指标，下一步是确定你要问什么类型的调查问题作为提醒。

A survey question is different from an evaluation question.

> 调查问题不同于评估问题。

An evaluation question is a key question about the outcomes, impact, and/or effectiveness of your project or program, whereas a survey question is designed to collect data, which can help you answer your evaluation questions.

> 评估问题是关于项目或计划的结果、影响和/或有效性的关键问题，而调查问题旨在收集数据，这可以帮助您回答评估问题。

In other words, survey questions are a more direct interpretation-解释,理解 of your evaluation questions, designed to get data points.

> 换句话说，调查问题是对你的评估问题的更直接的解释，旨在获得数据点。

Let's consider a specific example: the Sauce & Spoon evaluation question that asks, "To what extent do tablets increase work performance-表现?"

> 让我们考虑一个具体的例子:酱勺评估问题，“平板电脑在多大程度上提高了工作表现?”

One of the indicators of work performance is how much **side work**-兼职工作 the staff are able to complete during a shift-轮班.

> 工作绩效的指标之一是员工在轮班期间能够完成多少兼职工作。

Some corresponding survey questions might be: Are the tablets easy to use?

> 一些相应的调查问题可能是:平板电脑容易使用吗?

Was there enough time during the training to practice and ask questions?

> 在培训期间有足够的时间来练习和提问吗?

On average, how many of your side work tasks are you able to complete during a shift?

> 平均来说，你在轮班期间能完成多少兼职工作?

Since using the tablets, how often have you sent back an incorrect order?

> 自从使用这些平板电脑以来，你有多少次退回错误的订单?

The answers to these questions will give you data to track and answer your evaluation questions.

> 这些问题的答案将为您提供跟踪和回答评估问题的数据。

---

So how do you write effective survey questions that will address what you're trying to evaluate?

> 那么如何写出有效的调查问题来解决你想要评估的问题呢?

There are two different types of survey questions you can ask, open-ended and closed-ended questions.

> 你可以问两种不同类型的调查问题，开放式和封闭式问题。

Open-ended questions require more than one-word answers, such as yes or no.

> 开放式问题需要不止一个词的答案，比如“是”或“否”。

They ask respondents to answer in their own words.

> 他们要求受访者用自己的话回答。

For example, what went well during the presentation-演示?

> 例如，在演示过程中什么进展顺利?

What did you find most useful or interesting about the presentation?

> 你觉得演讲中最有用或最有趣的是什么?

The point is that the respondent has to construct-构建 their own answer to the question rather than selecting from a list of predetermined-预先确定 answer choices.

> 关键是被调查者必须构建自己的答案，而不是从预先确定的答案列表中进行选择。

---

Closed-ended questions can be answered with a single response, like yes or no or true or false or selecting a single answer from a list.

> 封闭式问题可以用一个答案来回答，比如是或否、真或假，或者从一个列表中选择一个答案。

Let's examine three types of closed-ended questions in more detail.

> 让我们更详细地研究三种类型的封闭式问题。

The first type of closed-ended question asks for yes/no or true or false answers.

> 第一种封闭式问题要求回答是/否或对或错。

These are questions like "Did you order an appetizer-开胃小吃?" and "Have you eaten at this restaurant before?"

> 这些问题包括“你点了开胃菜吗?”和“你以前在这家餐厅吃过饭吗?”

The second type of closed-ended question is multiple choice.

> 第二种封闭式问题是选择题。

Multiple choice questions have—you guessed it—multiple answer choices.

> 多项选择题——你猜对了——是多项选择题。

You're usually instructed to select one of the answer options or to select all that apply.

> 你通常会被指示选择一个答案选项或选择所有适用的选项。

The question could be something like "How often do you dine-进餐,吃饭 at this location each month?"

> 问题可以是这样的:“你每个月在这家餐厅吃几次饭?”

and then a range of answer options like zero to one, two to three, four to five, and five or more.

> 然后是一系列答案选项，比如0到1、2到3、4到5、5或更多。

A third kind of closed-ended question is a scaled question.

> 第三种封闭性问题是量表问题。

Scaled questions provide more than two options, but they're different from multiple choice because they ask the respondent to rate their answers on a scale.

> 量表问题提供了两个以上的选项，但它们不同于多项选择题，因为它们要求被调查者在量表上对他们的答案进行评分。

For example, how often something occurs, how much they like or dislike something, or how important they think something is.

> 例如，某事发生的频率，他们喜欢或不喜欢某事的程度，或者他们认为某事有多重要。

A sample scaled question might be "On a scale of one to five, how do you rate your overall dining experience, with one being poor and five being excellent?"

> 一个样本问题可能是“从1到5分，你给你的整体用餐体验打几分，1分差，5分极好?”

Regardless of the question type, creating good survey questions is a skill that takes a bit of practice.

> 不管是什么类型的问题，创造好的调查问题是一项需要练习的技能。

---

Here's some tips.

> 这里有一些建议。

First and foremost-最重要的, make sure your questions are asking what you mean to ask.

> 首先，确保你的问题是问你想问的问题。

Each question should be specific and address only one measurable aspect.

> 每个问题都应该是具体的，并且只涉及一个可衡量的方面。

Be careful not to make assumptions about your respondents-调查对象.

> 注意不要对你的受访者做出假设。

For example, don't assume that everyone taking your survey knows or enjoys the same things or has similar life experiences.

> 例如，不要假设接受调查的每个人都知道或喜欢同样的事情，或者有相似的生活经历。

Ask questions and provide answer options that allow people to answer accurately about their experience.

> 提出问题并提供答案选项，让人们准确地回答他们的经历。

At the same time, you want to make sure that your questions don't provide too much detail or information.

> 与此同时，你要确保你的问题不会提供太多细节或信息。

If you do, you might end up influencing the respondent to answer in a certain way, which could unintentionally-无意地,非故意地 create bias-偏见.

> 如果你这样做，你可能最终会影响被调查者以某种方式回答，这可能会无意中产生偏见。

---

Wow, that was a lot of information.

> 哇，这信息可真多。

Let's review so it's fresh in our minds.

> 让我们复习一下，让我们记住它。

Survey data helps you determine if you're achieving your quality goals and where you need to make adjustments.

> 调查数据可以帮助您确定是否实现了质量目标以及需要进行调整的地方。

Surveys can also help you understand what's working and what's not working, help you assess the criteria you want to evaluate, and provide data that will point out whether you've met your quality standards.

> 调查还可以帮助你了解什么是有效的，什么是不有效的，帮助你评估你想评估的标准，并提供数据来指出你是否达到了你的质量标准。

The survey development process includes developing evaluation questions, defining your evaluation indicators, and determining what type of survey to design and questions to ask.

> 调查开发过程包括开发评估问题，定义评估指标，确定要设计的调查类型和要问的问题。

In the next activity, you'll review your quality management plan and create survey questions for one of Sauce & Spoon's evaluation questions.

> 在接下来的活动中，您将回顾您的质量管理计划，并为 Sauce & Spoon 的评估问题之一创建调查问题。

Then I'll meet you in the next video to discuss how to present the data that gets collected from your survey.

> 下个视频我们会讨论如何展示从调查中收集到的数据。



# Presenting data

> 数据展示

## Delivering-发表 an evaluation presentation-报告

> 发表评估报告

Hey there!

Welcome back.

In the last video, we discussed the value of feedback surveys and how to create effective survey questions.

> 在上一个视频中，我们讨论了反馈调查的价值以及如何创建有效的调查问题。

Then you had the chance to write some questions for one of Sauce and Spoon's user feedback surveys.

> 然后你有机会为 Sauce and Spoon 的用户反馈调查写一些问题。

Since the last video, the Sauce and Spoon surveys have been administered-执行,实施 and the data has been collected.

> 自上一段视频以来，Sauce and Spoon  调查一直在进行，并收集了数据。

This data is the result of your evaluation, so now it's time to analyze the data and report your findings on how well the project is measuring up to its quality standards.

> 这些数据是您评估的结果，因此现在是时候分析这些数据并报告您的发现，以了解项目是否符合其质量标准。

---

In this video, we'll cover tips and best practices for determining your audience, choosing the style of your evaluation report, and delivering an effective presentation.

> 在本视频中，我们将介绍一些技巧和最佳实践，以确定您的受众，选择评估报告的风格，并提供有效的报告。

We'll also discuss how to distinguish-区别,分清 between reviewing data and presenting-提出 an evaluation.

> 我们还将讨论如何区分审查数据和提出评估。

Then, in the next activity, you'll apply what you've learned to analyze survey data and create presentation slides-幻灯片 for an upcoming stakeholder meeting.

> 然后，在下一个活动中，你将运用你所学到的知识来分析调查数据，并为即将到来的利益相关者会议创建演示幻灯片。

You'll be able to add these slides to your project management portfolio-作品集 to demonstrate your ability to synthesize-综合,结合 and summarize data into recommendations for a particular audience.

> 您将能够将这些幻灯片添加到您的项目管理作品集中，以展示您综合和汇总数据并为特定受众提供建议的能力。

There are different ways to present an evaluation, and you'll need to decide which style is best for your project and audience. 

> 有不同的方式来展示评估，你需要决定哪种风格最适合你的项目和观众。

Start out by considering your audience.

> 首先考虑一下你的听众。

Think about what's most meaningful to them, as well as how much time they have.

> 想想什么对他们最有意义，以及他们有多少时间。

If your audience is a mix of roles or groups like team members, managers, stakeholders, and executives, consider the best way to share information with each group.

> 如果您的受众是各种角色或群体的混合体，如团队成员、经理、利益相关者和高管，请考虑与每个群体共享信息的最佳方式。

In some cases, you'll need to present the same data in different ways.

> 在某些情况下，您需要以不同的方式表示相同的数据。

Different audiences have different reasons for wanting information.

> 不同的受众有不同的获取信息的原因。

Your team, for example, could benefit from a detailed report so they can address aspects of the project they're responsible for. 

> 例如，你的团队可以从一份详细的报告中受益，这样他们就可以解决他们负责的项目的各个方面。

However, groups like senior stakeholders and executives typically do not need, want, or have the time for a detailed analysis. 

> 然而，像高级涉众和高管这样的团体通常不需要、不想要或没有时间进行详细的分析。

They would rather have a summary of the most important information and the impact it has on their investment in the project. 

> 他们宁愿有一个最重要的信息的摘要，以及它对他们在项目中的投资的影响。

After you've considered your audience, you should create a detailed evaluation report that addresses your evaluation questions. 

> 在你考虑了你的受众之后，你应该创建一个详细的评估报告来解决你的评估问题。

You can then take the detailed report and summarize the information into the most appropriate-合适的,相称的 format for a given audience.

> 然后，您可以获取详细的报告，并将信息总结为最适合给定受众的格式。 

In addition to a full report, two common reporting styles include a summary sheet and a slide-based presentation.

> 除了完整的报告之外，两种常见的报告风格包括摘要表和基于幻灯片的演示文稿。

A summary sheet is a one- or two-page write-up with just the most relevant information.

> 摘要表是一到两页的总结，只包含最相关的信息。

Think of it as a flyer-传单 or snapshot of your findings.

> 把它想象成你的发现的传单或快照。

And a slide-based presentation uses digital slides to visually present information.

> 而基于幻灯片的演示使用数字幻灯片来直观地呈现信息。

Presenting evaluation findings should not just be a raw data report; your presentation needs to reflect what the data means and explain how it informs a response to the evaluation questions.

> 提交评估结果不应只是一份原始数据报告;你的演示需要反映数据的含义，并解释它如何告知对评估问题的回应。

In order to do this, you need to filter and analyze the data.

> 为了做到这一点，您需要过滤和分析数据。

This is probably the most important part because this is where you **make sense of**-理解,弄懂 the data for yourself.

> 这可能是最重要的部分，因为这是你自己理解数据的地方。

By filtering and analyzing, you become familiar with the results, the respondents, and what those results mean **in regards to**-关于,就…而言 project quality.

> 通过过滤和分析，您熟悉了结果、应答者，以及这些结果对项目质量的意义。

Here's the difference between reporting data and presenting evaluation findings.

> 这就是报告数据和展示评估结果之间的区别。

Let's say the survey data reveals that 36% of respondents-调查对象 reported a negative dining experience with the tablets, but what does that data mean?

> 假设调查数据显示，36%的受访者表示使用平板电脑的用餐体验不佳，但这一数据意味着什么?

It could mean several things.

> 这可能意味着几件事。

It could mean that the tablets weren't installed correctly, resulting in performance glitches-小故障.

> 这可能意味着平板电脑没有正确安装，从而导致性能故障。

It could mean the tablets were poor quality, so even if they were installed correctly, the tablets just didn't function very well.

> 这可能意味着平板电脑的质量很差，所以即使安装正确，平板电脑的功能也不是很好。

It could mean the staff wasn't trained well enough, resulting in delayed or incorrect-错误的 orders.

> 这可能意味着员工没有受过足够的培训，导致订单延迟或错误。

Or it could mean that respondents simply didn't like using the tablets and prefer a standard dining experience.

> 或者这可能意味着受访者只是不喜欢使用平板电脑，更喜欢标准的用餐体验。

You see, data alone isn't enough.

> 你看，只有数据是不够的。

You need to conduct additional analysis that explains the data.

> 您需要进行额外的分析来解释数据。

Your job is to figure out what the data means and explain how the data answers your evaluation questions.

> 你的工作是弄清楚数据的含义，并解释数据如何回答你的评估问题。

When you can explain what the data means in your own words, you'll have the basis for your presentation.

> 当你能用自己的话解释数据的含义时，你就有了演讲的基础。

A good way to start analyzing data to present is to look for trends, patterns, and anomalies-异常事物,反常现象.

> 开始分析要呈现的数据的一个好方法是寻找趋势、模式和异常。

Another tip is to share this process with some of your team members.

> 另一个技巧是与一些团队成员分享这个过程。

Taking turns sharing what you think the data means allows you to check your understanding and uncover additional information through your varied perspectives.

> 轮流分享你认为数据意味着什么，可以让你检查你的理解，并通过你不同的视角发现额外的信息。

After you've analyzed your data and know how you'd like to present it, shape the story of your findings by tying it all together into one cohesive-团结的,有凝聚力的 narrative-叙述.

> 在你分析了你的数据并知道你想要如何呈现它之后，通过将它们联系在一起形成一个有凝聚力的叙述来塑造你的发现故事。

Take some time to think about what you're hoping to achieve, the points you want to make, and the questions and concerns you want to answer.

> 花点时间想想你希望达到的目标，你想要表达的观点，以及你想要回答的问题和顾虑。

A great way to present an evaluation is through a story.

> 通过一个故事来呈现评估是一个很好的方法。

Storytelling is the process of turning facts into narrative to communicate something to your audience.

> 讲故事是将事实转化为叙述的过程，以便与观众交流。

This is essentially what you do when you present your evaluation findings—you tell the story of your data.

> 这基本上就是你在展示你的评估结果时所做的——你讲述你的数据故事。

We provide some great tips and more details of the storytelling process in those earlier courses, so check them out if you need more help.

> 在这些早期的课程中，我们提供了一些很棒的技巧和更多关于讲故事过程的细节，所以如果你需要更多的帮助，请查看它们。

For the tablet project, the point of the presentation is to demonstrate to stakeholders whether or not the project is successfully meeting quality standards, so you might start by reminding them of the overall goal and purpose of the project.

> 对于平板电脑项目，演示的重点是向涉众展示项目是否成功地达到了质量标准，因此您可以从提醒他们项目的总体目标和目的开始。

From there, identify the milestone that's being evaluated and how it's expected to meet the project goals.

> 从那里，确定正在评估的里程碑，以及如何期望它满足项目目标。

Explain what the data revealed, but don't cover every single data point or survey question.

> 解释数据揭示了什么，但不要涵盖每一个数据点或调查问题。

Again you're telling a story about the data, not presenting the raw data itself.

> 再说一次，你是在讲述一个关于数据的故事，而不是呈现原始数据本身。

Identify any major issues the data revealed and summarize the rest.

> 找出数据揭示的任何主要问题，并总结其余问题。

If the data reveals that things were going well, pick a few highlights-亮点 and move on.

> 如果数据显示事情进展顺利，挑出几个亮点，然后继续前进。

If there are some major failings, suggest-提议,建议 possible solutions or craft specific questions you need answers to.

> 如果有一些主要的缺点，提出可能的解决方案或提出你需要回答的具体问题。

> 在接下来的活动中，你将回顾 Sauce and Spoon 和勺子反馈调查的数据结果，并制作演示幻灯片，讲述你的评估故事。

Then you'll wrap up the section with a retrospective.

> 然后你将用回顾来结束这一部分。

See you soon.



## Evaluation presentations: Components and tips

> 评估演示：组件和提示

Once a survey has been administered-进行,实施 and all of the data has been collected for evaluation, you'll have what you need to prepare an **evaluation presentation**.

> 一旦进行了调查，所有的数据都被收集起来进行评估，你就有了准备评估报告所需的材料。

An evaluation presentation examines how well your project is working according to an identified set of standards. 

> 评估报告根据一组确定的标准检查您的项目的工作情况。

**What to include in your evaluation presentation**

> 你的评估报告应该包括什么内容

**Introduction**

> 简介

The introduction serves as a summary of your presentation and includes an overview of the project’s goals and desired outcomes.

> 引言是对你的演讲的总结，包括对项目目标和预期结果的概述。

It should include a summary of your findings, lessons learned, and recommendations moving forward.

> 它应该包括对你的发现、经验教训和建议的总结。

This is a very important section of your presentation, but keep it brief.

> 这是你演讲中非常重要的一部分，但要简短。

Your introduction should be no more than a paragraph-段,段落 and only include the most necessary information.  

> 你的介绍应该不超过一段，只包括最必要的信息。

**What is being evaluated and why**

> 评估的内容和原因

Here is where you will state the purpose of the evaluation.

> 在这里你要陈述评估的目的。

Remember, in the context of project quality management, the purpose of evaluation is to measure how well your project is meeting the established quality standards.

> 请记住，在项目质量管理的上下文中，评估的目的是衡量您的项目满足既定质量标准的程度。

Presenting evaluation findings to your stakeholders shows them how well the project is meeting quality standards and informs them of the project’s success.

> 向涉众展示评估结果，向他们展示项目满足质量标准的程度，并告知他们项目的成功。

To do this:

- State the goal, milestone, or deliverable that is being evaluated and the quality standards that were defined for that aspect of the project.

	> 说明正在评估的目标、里程碑或可交付成果，以及为项目的这些方面定义的质量标准。

- Include the evaluation questions and indicators that were used to evaluate each quality standard. 

	> 包括用于评价每个质量标准的评价问题和指标。

**Pro tip:** Remember, your stakeholders have limited time. When preparing your presentation, only select the most important standards and questions.

> **专业提示:**记住，你的利益相关者时间有限。在准备演讲时，只选择最重要的标准和问题。

**Evaluation findings**

> 评估发现

Now it’s time to state your findings.

> 现在是时候陈述你的发现了。

Give each standard its own section within this portion-一部分 of the presentation, and summarize what the findings mean for each standard.

> 在报告的这一部分中给每个标准一个单独的部分，并总结这些发现对每个标准的意义。

Make a clear judgment about the findings: What did you learn? What can you take away from the data? Tell the story of what the data means for the future of the project and for the stakeholders.

> 对调查结果做出明确的判断:你学到了什么?你能从这些数据中得出什么结论?讲述数据对项目未来和利益相关者的意义。

- Example: **"**The data reveals that 36% of users felt their dining experience was negatively impacted by the tablets."

	> 例如:“数据显示，36%的用户认为平板电脑对他们的用餐体验产生了负面影响。”

	It’s up to you to synthesize-综合,结合 that data and determine why that might be.

	> 这取决于你综合这些数据并确定为什么会这样。

	Maybe it’s because the tablet software wasn’t installed properly, resulting in glitchy technology.

	> 也许是因为平板电脑的软件安装不正确，导致技术出现故障。

	Or maybe it’s because the staff wasn’t trained effectively, and therefore the ordering process was seriously-严重的 delayed-推迟，拖延.

	> 也可能是因为员工没有接受过有效的培训，因此订购过程严重拖延。

	Maybe some customers just don’t want tablets taking their orders, and they prefer to deal with wait staff.

	> 也许有些顾客只是不想让平板电脑帮他们点餐，他们更喜欢和服务员打交道。

	Explain what the data means in a way that allows stakeholders to make decisions or declare-宣布,声明 this aspect of the project successful or not.

	> 以一种允许涉众做出决策或宣布项目这方面成功与否的方式解释数据的含义。

**Pro tip:** Visualize the data with graphs or charts to quickly convey-传达,传输 the message of the findings.

> **专业提示:**用图形或图表可视化数据，以快速传达调查结果的信息。



![Bar chart wxample: The data reveals that 36% of users felt their dining  experience was negatively impacted by the tablets.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/EOYCS7BHRtemAkuwR4bXrA_0aa76c627ca445e8bf88bcd12875da7e_NEW-C6M3L3R1.png?expiry=1706745600000&hmac=x7IhM63pL71TsK4cjUxKZqlagZZ6yZ0vzDBDcRqhEN4)

**Conclusion-结论,推论 with recommendations**

> 结论及建议

In your conclusion, state your findings again and propose a couple of recommendations for how to apply the findings to the next phase of the project.

> 在你的结论中，再次陈述你的发现，并就如何将这些发现应用到项目的下一阶段提出一些建议。

You can also outline how these findings may be used in future projects. 

> 您还可以概述如何在未来的项目中使用这些发现。



**How to format your presentation** 

> 如何设置演示文稿的格式

Slide-based presentations can be created using digital applications like Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint.

> 基于幻灯片的演示可以使用谷歌幻灯片或微软PowerPoint等数字应用程序创建。

This type of presentation uses images and succinct-简洁的,简明的 bullet points to provide the necessary information to stakeholders.

> 这种类型的演示使用图像和简洁的要点向涉众提供必要的信息。

Slide-based presentations typically include summarized information rather than lengthy, in-depth paragraphs.

> 基于幻灯片的演示通常包括概要信息，而不是冗长、深入的段落。

They are great tools for high-level presentations, when your stakeholders do not need to know every single project detail. 

> 当你的干系人不需要知道每一个项目的细节时，它们是高水平演示的好工具。



**Additional tips**

> 额外的提示

- **Tailor-迎合,使适应 communications to stakeholders**: When it comes to communicating important milestones to stakeholders, consider whom you are presenting to. Tailor your presentation to your audience in a way that they will understand and enjoy.

	> **为利益相关者量身定制沟通**:当涉及到向利益相关者传达重要里程碑时，要考虑你是在向谁展示。以一种观众能够理解并喜欢的方式来调整你的演讲。

- **Start with an interesting hook-吸引人的东西**: Begin your presentation with an ice breaker, joke, or an interesting visual aid to get your stakeholders’ attention right away. 

	> 以一个有趣的开场白开始:用一个破冰开场白、笑话或一个有趣的视觉辅助来开始你的演讲，以立即吸引利益相关者的注意力。

- **Use visuals throughout your presentation**: The use of visuals creates interest and keeps the audience engaged in your presentation. 

	> **在你的演讲中使用视觉效果**:视觉效果的使用可以增加观众的兴趣，让他们参与到你的演讲中。





# Facilitating retrospectives

> 促进回顾

## The value of retrospectives

Welcome back.

In the last video, you practiced your presentation skills by synthesizing data into evaluation findings and communicating those findings by creating slides to be shared with key stakeholders.

> 在上一个视频中，你通过将数据综合到评估结果中，并通过制作幻灯片与关键利益相关者分享这些结果，练习了你的演讲技巧。

In this video, we'll briefly review retrospectives and their value to a project team.

> 在本视频中，我们将简要回顾回顾及其对项目团队的价值。

Retrospectives are an example of quality control because they help teams adjust and improve processes as needed.

> 回顾是质量控制的一个例子，因为它们可以帮助团队根据需要调整和改进过程。

Coming up, you'll learn from Peta as she facilitates a retrospective.

> 接下来，你将向Peta学习，因为她主持了一次回顾。

You'll break down the conversations and extract-提取,提炼 the details you'll need to build into the retrospective document.

> 您将分解对话并提取需要构建到回顾性文档中的细节。

---

Let's start with a refresher on retrospectives.

> 让我们从回顾开始。

A retrospective, sometimes referred to as a retro, is a workshop-研讨会 or meeting that gives project teams time to reflect on a project.

> 回顾会议，有时也被称为retro，是给项目团队时间来反思项目的研讨会或会议。

A retrospective gives you a chance to discuss project successes and setbacks-挫折,阻碍 and to learn from mistakes.

> 回顾会让你有机会讨论项目的成功和挫折，并从错误中吸取教训。

Though retrospectives often happen at the very end of a project, they're also a helpful process improvement tool that can and should be used throughout the project life cycle, especially after reaching a project milestone.

> 虽然回顾经常发生在项目的最后阶段，但它们也是一种有用的过程改进工具，可以而且应该在整个项目生命周期中使用，特别是在达到项目里程碑之后。

For example, right after implementing the tablets and testing them with beta users is a great time for a Sauce &amp; Spoon retrospective.

> 例如，在执行了平板电脑并让 beta 用户进行测试之后，便是开发者的最佳时机 Sauce &amp; Spoon的回顾。

You could celebrate parts of the project that have gone well so far and identify opportunities for improvement as the project moves toward upcoming milestones.

> 您可以庆祝项目到目前为止进展顺利的部分，并在项目走向即将到来的里程碑时确定改进的机会。

Retrospectives have lots of benefits.

> 回顾有很多好处。

They encourage team building by providing team members with the opportunity to understand different perspectives within the team.

> 他们通过为团队成员提供了解团队内部不同观点的机会来鼓励团队建设。

They also facilitate improved collaboration on future projects, and they promote positive changes in future procedures-程序,步骤 and processes.

> 它们还促进了未来项目的协作，并促进了未来程序和过程的积极变化。

Because a retrospective is a specific type of meeting, its crucial to have an agenda-议事日程 to help guide the discussion, organize the meeting, and document learnings.

> 因为回顾会议是一种特殊类型的会议，所以有一个议程来帮助指导讨论、组织会议和记录学习成果是至关重要的。

As the project manager, you need to manage the tone of the conversation, make sure that every team member feels included, and identify details that will be recorded in the retrospective document for future reference.

> 作为项目经理，您需要管理谈话的语气，确保每个团队成员都感到被包括在内，并确定将记录在回顾性文档中的细节，以供将来参考。

In other words, it's your role to facilitate a respectful and productive retrospective discussion that recognizes successes and areas for improvement.

> 换句话说，你的角色是促进一场相互尊重且富有成效的回顾性讨论，以确认成功和需要改进的地方。

---

Let's recap the main ideas.

> 让我们回顾一下主要思想。

A retrospective is a workshop or meeting that gives project teams time to reflect on a project.

> 回顾是给项目团队时间来反思项目的研讨会或会议。

Three main purposes of retrospectives are to encourage team building, facilitate improved collaboration, and promote positive changes.

> 回顾的三个主要目的是鼓励团队建设，促进改进的协作，促进积极的变化。

And remember, it's your role as project manager to facilitate a respectful and productive retrospective discussion that recognizes successes and areas for improvement.

> 记住，作为项目经理，你的职责是促进一场相互尊重、富有成效的回顾性讨论，以确认成功和需要改进的地方。

In this next activity, you'll practice preparing for a retrospective by creating a list that includes successes and areas for improvement.

> 在接下来的活动中，你将通过创建一个包括成功和需要改进的地方的列表来练习为回顾做准备。

Once you're done with this video, you'll observe how Peta interacts with her team members as she conducts the retrospective and add information to your document.

> 一旦你完成了这个视频，你将观察Peta如何与她的团队成员进行回顾和添加信息到你的文档。

See you soon.



## Retrospectives: Encouraging participation

> 回顾:鼓励参与

Hey again.

In the last video, we reviewed the importance of retrospectives.

> 在上一个视频中，我们回顾了回顾会议的重要性。

Now it's time to figure out how to deal with the sometimes tricky aspects of retrospectives.

> 现在是时候弄清楚如何处理回顾中有时棘手的方面了。

In this video, I'll take you through effective techniques you can use to address a lack of participation during a retrospective.

> 在这段视频中，我将向你介绍一些有效的技巧，你可以使用这些技巧来解决回顾期间缺乏参与的问题。

Low participation can prevent-阻止,阻碍 a project team from making meaningful process improvements.

> 参与率低会阻碍项目团队进行有意义的过程改进。

But if you've got methods you can rely on to help boost-使增长,推动 participation, you'll be more prepared to lead any kind of retrospective throughout your career in project management.

> 但是，如果你有一些可以依靠的方法来帮助促进参与，那么在你的项目管理职业生涯中，你就会更准备好领导任何类型的回顾。

After this video, you'll review supporting materials that will demonstrate how Peta handles lack of participation in a retrospective. 

> 在本视频之后，您将回顾支持性材料，这些材料将演示Peta如何处理缺乏参与的回顾。

You'll be able to identify and add several new details to your retrospective document.

> 您将能够识别和添加一些新的细节到您的回顾文档。

---

First, let's just say it, retrospectives can be a bit intimidating-吓人的,令人紧张不安的,令人胆怯的.

> 首先，让我们这么说吧，回顾可能有点吓人。

When you host-主持 a retrospective with your team, you draw attention not only to project successes, but also to challenges.

> 当你和你的团队一起主持回顾时，你不仅要关注项目的成功，也要关注挑战。

If a team feels uncomfortable voicing challenges, then they might not be very eager to participate during a retrospective discussion.

> 如果一个团队对提出挑战感到不舒服，那么他们可能不太愿意参与回顾性讨论。

So before jumping into any retrospective, make sure to ask yourself, does your team seem likely to contribute to the discussion? 

> 因此，在进入任何回顾之前，一定要问自己，你的团队是否有可能为讨论做出贡献?

If you feel like the answer might be no, follow along as we discuss a few useful techniques we use at Google to encourage participation in a retrospective.

> 如果你觉得答案可能是否定的，那么跟随我们讨论一些我们在Google用来鼓励参与回顾的有用技巧。

----

One technique I use frequently to encourage participation is to create a safe environment for the team.

> 我经常使用的一个鼓励参与的技巧是为团队创造一个安全的环境。

To create a safe environment, you might open the meeting by adopting a policy of what's said here stays here, what's learned here leaves.

> 为了创造一个安全的环境，你可以在会议开始时采取这样的政策:这里说的话留在这里，这里学到的东西留下。

Remind the team that the retrospective is a meeting free-不含..的 from stakeholders or customers, and that it's a safe space where the team can speak directly about problems.

> 提醒团队，回顾会议是一个没有涉众或客户参与的会议，这是一个安全的空间，团队可以直接讨论问题。

To help increase participation, it can also be helpful to model the kind of participation you'd like to elicit-引出,得到 from your team.

> 为了帮助提高参与度，你也可以为你想从团队中引出的那种参与建模。

So if you're trying to help your team feel comfortable speaking candidly-坦白地,率直地 about project successes and challenges, you could set the tone by starting the discussion with your own successes and challenges.

> 所以，如果你想让你的团队在坦率地谈论项目的成功和挑战时感到自在，你可以用自己的成功和挑战来开始讨论，以此来定下基调。

Before the meeting, try preparing a few examples of tasks or processes you know you could have handled better.

> 在会议之前，试着准备一些你知道你可以处理得更好的任务或过程的例子。

If you know that you made a mistake on a project task, say it out loud.

> 如果你知道自己在项目任务中犯了错误，大声说出来。

For example, maybe you made a paperwork-文书工作 error that slowed down tablet delivery by two business days.

> 例如，也许你在文书工作上犯了一个错误，导致平板电脑的交付延迟了两个工作日。

Be honest about your mistake and talk about how you'll avoid similar errors going forward.

> 诚实地面对你的错误，并谈谈你将如何避免类似的错误。

When you admit-承认,招认 to your own mistakes, you make it okay for the rest of your team to share their mistakes too.

> 当你承认自己的错误时，你就可以让团队的其他成员也分享他们的错误。

---

Another useful technique to encourage participation is to pose-引起,提出 a group question and ask for individual responses.

> 另一个鼓励参与的有用技巧是提出一个小组问题，并要求个人回答。

For example, you could ask your team members to each think of one success and one challenge from the project so far, then ask each team member to share their responses.

> 例如，您可以要求您的团队成员每个人思考到目前为止项目中的一个成功和一个挑战，然后要求每个团队成员分享他们的反应。

If you find that a question you've asked doesn't get the kind of response you'd hoped for, try phrasing-用…方式表达，以…措辞表达 it in a different way.

> 如果你发现你问的问题没有得到你希望的那种回答，试着用不同的方式来表达。

For example, if questions like, "What went well?" and, "What went wrong?" don't get you the responses you'd like, try alternatives. 

> 例如，如果像“什么进展顺利?”和“什么出了问题?”这样的问题没有得到你想要的答案，那就试试别的办法。

Maybe ask something like, "What about this project should we start, stop, and continue?"

> 也许可以问这样的问题:“这个项目我们应该开始、停止和继续做什么?”

Finally, if your team is participating but contributing only very recent-最近的,最新的 successes and challenges, it may be helpful to review the project timeline.

> 最后，如果你的团队参与其中，但只是在最近取得了成功和挑战，那么回顾一下项目时间表可能会有所帮助。

This is a technique for encouraging teammates to think further back in the project life cycle to identify successes and challenges. 

> 这是一种鼓励团队成员在项目生命周期中进一步思考以确定成功和挑战的技术。

If you remind your team of the project timeline, you can refresh their memories and spark more discussion about the entire project.

> 如果你提醒你的团队项目时间表，你可以刷新他们的记忆，并引发更多关于整个项目的讨论。

---

Let's do a quick recap.

Low participation during a retrospective can prevent a project team from making meaningful process improvements.

> 回顾期间的低参与度会阻碍项目团队做出有意义的过程改进。

Some effective techniques to encourage participation include: establish a safe environment for the team, model the kind of participation you'd like to elicit-引出,得到 from your team, pose a group question and ask for individual responses, and review the project timeline.

> 鼓励参与的一些有效技巧包括:为团队建立一个安全的环境，为你想从团队中引出的那种参与建模，提出一个小组问题并要求个人回答，以及回顾项目时间表。

In the upcoming activity, as you review the supporting materials, you'll get a look at how Peta handles lack of participation in a retrospective and you'll add some content to your accompanying-陪伴,陪同 retrospective document.

> 在接下来的活动中，当你回顾支持材料时，你将看到Peta如何处理缺乏参与的回顾，你将在随附的回顾文档中添加一些内容。

After you've finished the activity meet me in the next video to discuss techniques for encouraging accountability.

> 当你完成这个活动后，在下一个视频中与我会面，讨论鼓励问责制的技巧。

Bye for now.



## Retrospectives: Encouraging accountability

> 回顾：鼓励问责制

In the last video, we explored ways you could address a lack of participation during a retrospective.

> 在上一个视频中，我们探讨了如何解决回顾中缺乏参与的问题。

In this video, I'll share some techniques for encouraging accountability during a retrospective.

> 在这个视频中，我将分享一些在回顾中鼓励问责的技巧。

Accountability refers to being responsible for decisions associated with a project or task.

> 问责制指的是对与项目或任务相关的决策负责。

Accountability is a really important part of a productive retrospective.

> 问责制是高效回顾中非常重要的一部分。

If a retrospective is meant to serve as a helpful tool for process improvement, then participants in the retrospective need to be honest about how the team could have performed better.

> 如果回顾旨在作为过程改进的有用工具，那么回顾的参与者需要诚实地说明团队如何可以更好地执行。

Only then can the team figure out how to improve in the future.

> 只有这样，团队才能弄清楚如何在未来改进。

Knowing how to push a team to take accountability for a given project will be a huge benefit to you in your career.

> 知道如何推动一个团队对一个给定的项目负责将对你的职业生涯有巨大的好处。

After this video, you'll review supporting materials that demonstrate how Peta handles individual and team accountability in a retrospective.

> 在本视频之后，您将回顾证明Peta如何在回顾中处理个人和团队责任的支持材料。

Then you'll identify and add new details to your retrospective document.

> 然后，您将确定并向回顾性文档添加新的细节。

Before we move on, I want to make one point clear.

> 在我们继续之前，我想澄清一点。

Accountability and blame-责怪,责备 are two very different things, and only accountability belongs in a retrospective.

> 问责和指责是完全不同的两件事，只有问责才属于回顾。

Blame shuts people down instead of empowering them to share honestly.

> 责备会让人们闭嘴，而不是让他们诚实地分享。

Accountability doesn't involve assigning blame to specific team members for mistakes.

> 问责制并不包括将错误归咎于特定的团队成员。

Instead, it encourages the team to think holistically-整体论地 about mistakes and challenges in identify solutions for the future.

> 相反，它鼓励团队从整体上考虑错误和挑战，以确定未来的解决方案。

Another benefit of accountability is that it encourages ownership.

> 问责制的另一个好处是它鼓励所有权。

When a team member feels ownership over an aspect of the project, they may be more motivated throughout the project to ensure that aspect meets quality standards and helps the project progress towards the goal.

> 当团队成员对项目的某个方面感到拥有所有权时，他们可能会在整个项目中更有动力，以确保该方面符合质量标准，并帮助项目朝着目标前进。

---

So let's discuss some great techniques you can use to encourage accountability during a retrospective.

> 因此，让我们来讨论一些你可以用来在回顾中鼓励问责的技巧。

One technique I like to use is to come prepared with specific challenges to discuss as a group.

> 我喜欢使用的一个技巧是准备好具体的挑战，然后作为一个小组来讨论。

This could be especially helpful if you find that your team wants to focus discussion only on project successes.

> 如果您发现您的团队只希望将讨论集中在项目成功上，这将特别有用。

To encourage accountability, call attention to a specific challenge.

> 为了鼓励问责制，要引起人们对特定挑战的注意。

Maybe the Sauce & Spoon kitchen managers provided feedback that they felt **left out**-被忽略,被遗漏 of decisions made by the general managers.

> 也许Sauce & Spoon的厨房经理们提供的反馈让他们觉得自己被总经理的决策忽略了。

During a retrospective, you might share this feedback with the group and asked the team to help figure out problems that led to this feedback.

> 在回顾期间，您可能会与团队分享这些反馈，并要求团队帮助找出导致这些反馈的问题。

---

Another useful technique is to turn team complaints-抱怨,投诉 into smart-明智的 action items.

> 另一个有用的技巧是将团队抱怨转化为明智的行动项目。

You've learned that project goals should be SMART, which means that their specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound.

> 您已经了解到项目目标应该是SMART的，这意味着它们是具体的、可测量的、可实现的、相关的和有时间限制的。

But here's another tip, action items could be SMART too.

> 但这里有另一个提示，行动项目也可以是SMART。

If you find that your team does more complaining than problem solving, pick a complaint-抱怨,投诉 and turn it into a SMART action item. 

> 如果你发现你的团队抱怨多于解决问题，挑一个抱怨并把它变成一个SMART行动项目。

For example, let's go back to our example where the kitchen managers feel out of the loop on general decision making.

> 例如，让我们回到我们的例子，厨房经理感觉在一般决策的循环之外。

As a project manager, it might be a good idea to add an action item to invite the kitchen manager to the weekly staff check-in meetings.

> 作为一个项目经理，添加一个行动项目来邀请厨房经理参加每周的员工登记会议可能是个好主意。

If you want to take it one step further, you can even add a five-minute agenda item for the kitchen manager to discuss issues and get feedback.

> 如果你想更进一步，你甚至可以增加一个五分钟的议程项目，让厨房经理讨论问题并获得反馈。

Then you could make a plan to check in two months to find out if they're still feeling this way or if they feel more included.

> 然后你可以制定一个计划，在两个月后再检查一下，看看他们是否仍然有这种感觉，或者他们是否觉得自己被包容了。

By showing your team how to turn complaints into action, you can help your team become more solution oriented.

> 通过向您的团队展示如何将抱怨转化为行动，您可以帮助您的团队变得更加以解决方案为导向。

---

When it comes to encouraging accountability, it's also a good idea to push the team to identify its role in creating a given challenge.

> 当谈到鼓励问责制时，推动团队在创造给定挑战时确定其角色也是一个好主意。

Your team might seem inclined-倾向于,倾斜 to focus only on challenges they feel they had no control or influence over, like a late delivery from your tablet supplier, for example.

> 你的团队似乎倾向于只关注他们无法控制或影响的挑战，比如平板电脑供应商的延迟交货。

When discussing challenges that the team seems reluctant-勉强的,不情愿的 to take responsibility for, you can help your team think about the series of events that led to a given challenge.

> 当讨论团队似乎不愿意承担的挑战时，您可以帮助团队思考导致给定挑战的一系列事件。

Then, you might push your team to identify a moment in that series of events when they missed an opportunity to recognize and address the problem.

> 然后，您可能会敦促您的团队在这一系列事件中找出他们错过了认识和解决问题的机会的时刻。

---

Let's go back to the tablet supplier delivery issue.

> 让我们回到平板电脑供应商交货的问题上来。

Maybe if someone on the team had been assigned the responsibility of managing the tablet supplier vendor early on in the project, they might have set up weekly check-in calls with the vendor.

> 也许如果团队中的某个人在项目早期就被分配了管理平板电脑供应商的责任，他们可能会与供应商建立每周的检查电话。

This could have given the restaurants the foresight-先见之明,预见 to plan for and work around the missed delivery.

> 这可以让餐馆有先见之明，为错过的送货做好计划并采取措施。

When you help your team identify its own role in creating challenges, you encourage reflection that might lead to helpful insights and ideas for process improvements.

> 当您帮助您的团队确定自己在创造挑战中的角色时，您就鼓励了可能导致有助于过程改进的见解和想法的反思。

As your team talks about various challenges they faced, make sure criticism-批评,批判 remains constructive.

> 当你的团队谈论他们面临的各种挑战时，确保批评是建设性的。

Constructive criticism is a respectful form of feedback that is intended-预期的,打算中的 to help the recipient improve a piece of work.

> 建设性的批评是一种尊重的反馈形式，旨在帮助接受者改进工作。

If criticism-批评,批判 of a portion of the project begins to go from constructive to unhelpful or harsh, it will be your role as the project manager to redirect-重新使用 the conversation.

> 如果对项目的一部分的批评开始从建设性转向无益或苛刻，那么作为项目经理的你就需要重新引导对话。

To change the subject, try to detach-使分离 the challenge being discussed from any specific person in the room.

> 要改变话题，试着把正在讨论的挑战与房间里的任何特定的人分开。

You can do this by steering the conversation toward process improvements that the entire team can learn from.

> 您可以通过将对话导向整个团队都可以从中学习的过程改进来做到这一点。

---

Let's review the main ideas.

Accountability and blame are two very different things, and only accountability belongs in a retrospective.

> 问责和指责是完全不同的两件事，只有问责才属于回顾。

Accountability refers to being responsible for decisions associated with a project or task.

> 问责制指的是对与项目或任务相关的决策负责。

Accountability is about encouraging the team to think holistically-整体论地,全面地 about mistakes and challenges and encouraging ownership.

> 问责制是鼓励团队从整体上考虑错误和挑战，并鼓励所有权。

Some techniques you can use to encourage accountability during a retrospective include: come prepared with specific challenges to discuss as a group.

> 在回顾中，你可以使用一些技巧来鼓励问责，包括:准备好具体的挑战，作为一个小组来讨论。

Turn team complaints into SMART action items.

> 将团队抱怨转化为SMART行动项目。

Push the team to identify its role in creating a given challenge, and detach the challenge being discussed from any specific person in the room.

> 推动团队确定其在创建给定挑战中的角色，并将正在讨论的挑战与房间中的任何特定人员分离开来。

In the upcoming activity you'll observe as Peta encourages accountability during retrospectives, and you'll keep building out your retrospective document.

> 在接下来的活动中，你将看到Peta在回顾中鼓励问责制，你将继续构建你的回顾文档。

After you've completed the upcoming activity, meet me in the next video to discuss techniques for addressing negativity in a retrospective.

> 在你完成了即将到来的活动之后，在下一个视频中与我会面，讨论在回顾中解决消极情绪的技巧。



## Retrospectives: Addressing negativity

> 回顾:解决消极因素

Welcome back.

In the last video, we discussed some ways you could encourage accountability in a retrospective.

> 在上一个视频中，我们讨论了在回顾中鼓励问责制的一些方法。

In this video, you'll learn how to address negativity in a retrospective.

> 在这个视频中，你将学习如何在回顾中处理消极情绪。

Thoughtfully-深思熟虑 handling negativity is an important skill you'll need in order to effectively lead productive discussions in the future.

> 为了在未来有效地领导富有成效的讨论，深思熟虑地处理消极情绪是你需要的一项重要技能。

The ability to guide discussions that break down project performance while maintaining a constructive and positive tone will help you identify and improve problem areas of a specific project.

> 在保持建设性和积极的语气的同时，指导分解项目绩效的讨论的能力将帮助您识别和改进特定项目的问题区域。

After this video, you'll observe Peta carefully handle negativity as she leads a retrospective.

> 在这个视频之后，你会看到Peta在主持回顾时小心翼翼地处理消极情绪。

Then you'll apply similar techniques as you wrap up your own retrospective document.

> 然后，您将在总结自己的回顾性文档时应用类似的技术。

Before you do your own retrospective, it's important to ask yourself, is this conversation likely to feel stressful for the team? 

> 在你进行回顾之前，重要的是要问问自己，这次谈话是否会给团队带来压力?

Sometimes the answer will be yes.

> 有时答案是肯定的。

Let's talk about why negativity sometimes comes up during retrospective discussions.

> 让我们来谈谈为什么在回顾讨论中有时会出现消极情绪。

---

Retrospectives are a great way to build trust, honesty, and direct communication with a team.

> 回顾是与团队建立信任、诚实和直接沟通的好方法。

But keep in mind, if the environment doesn't feel psychologically-心理上地,心理学地 safe to the team, it's very easy for a retrospective to turn negative.

> 但请记住，如果团队在心理上感觉环境不安全，那么回顾会议很容易产生负面影响。

Negativity could make it more difficult to hold a productive discussion that identifies solutions to project challenges.

> 消极的态度会使进行富有成效的讨论以确定项目挑战的解决方案变得更加困难。

If you sense subtle-不易察觉的,微妙的 or even obvious-明显的,显然的 negativity during a retrospective discussion, here are some techniques you can use to change the tone of the meeting and guide the team toward a more positive outlook-展望.

> 如果你在回顾讨论中感觉到微妙甚至明显的消极情绪，这里有一些技巧可以用来改变会议的基调，引导团队朝着更积极的方向发展。

To address team negativity, aim to set a positive tone at the start of the meeting. 

> 为了解决团队的消极情绪，在会议开始时设定一个积极的基调。

Kick off by highlighting project successes.

> 首先强调项目的成功。

Maybe the team received positive feedback from a stakeholder, or you could thank the team for their hard work in reaching a major milestone.

> 也许团队从涉众那里得到了积极的反馈，或者您可以感谢团队为达到重要里程碑所做的辛勤工作。

Determine how you'll set the tone of the meeting.

> 确定你将如何确定会议的基调。

Meeting props-道具 can help with this.

> 会面道具可以帮助你做到这一点。

For example, you might hand out an even number of green and red index cards to each participant and ask attendees to write successes on the green cards and challenges on the red cards.

> 例如，您可以向每个参与者分发偶数的绿色和红色索引卡，并要求参与者在绿色卡片上写下成功，在红色卡片上写下挑战。

Passing out green cards might subtly-精细地,巧妙地,敏锐地 encourage the team to think of successes in addition to challenges.

> 发放绿卡可能会巧妙地鼓励团队在挑战之外考虑成功。

Even on teams with a generally positive overall dynamic, it's always possible for negativity to come up.

> 即使是在整体氛围积极的团队中，也有可能出现消极情绪。

So it might be a good idea to try anticipating any potential negativity by meeting one on one with team members before the retrospective happens.

> 因此，在回顾之前，通过与团队成员进行一对一的会面，尝试预测任何潜在的负面影响可能是一个好主意。

If you get the feeling that one team member is likely to bring a negative attitude to the retrospective, try asking yourself a few questions.

> 如果你觉得某个团队成员可能会在回顾会上持消极态度，试着问自己几个问题。

Does this person feel insecure about the value they add to this team?

> 这个人是否对自己给团队带来的价值感到不安?

Does this person receive negative feedback on the quality of their work?

> 这个人的工作质量是否收到过负面反馈?

Understanding the root of the negativity can help you figure out how to help the person engage with the group in a more positive way.

> 了解消极情绪的根源可以帮助你找出如何帮助这个人以一种更积极的方式融入团队。

For example, if you sense the person is feeling insecure, you could try reassuring-使安心,使消除疑虑 them of their value.

> 例如，如果你感觉到对方没有安全感，你可以试着让他们相信自己的价值。

A single negative voice can derail-阻挠,破坏 otherwise productive discussions.

> 一个消极的声音可能会破坏原本富有成效的讨论。

As the retrospective leader, it's your role to step in when one person's negativity dominates-统治,支配 the conversation.

> 作为回顾型领导者，当一个人的消极情绪主导了整个谈话时，你的角色就是介入。

To deal with negative participation from an individual team member, consider asking team members individually to share their thoughts.

> 要处理个别团队成员的消极参与，可以考虑单独要求团队成员分享他们的想法。

Calling on team members individually does a few things.

> 单独拜访团队成员可以做一些事情。

It gives each person room to share challenges.

> 它给每个人分享挑战的空间。

It helps them model solution-oriented thinking for their negative team member. 

> 这有助于他们为消极的团队成员树立以解决方案为导向的思维模式。

And it discourages the negative team member from dominating-统治,支配 the conversation by responding to every question.

> 它还会阻止消极的团队成员通过回答每个问题来主导谈话。

Finally, you might call a meeting break-休息.

> 最后，你可能会要求会议休息。

A timeout is a great way to help deescalate-缓和 the situation.

> 暂停是帮助缓和局势的好方法。

It's good to remember that there's no single technique that fits every scenario.

> 最好记住，没有一种技术适用于所有场景。

How you choose to address negativity will depend on the situation.

> 如何处理消极情绪取决于具体情况。

---

Let's review.

To address negativity during a retrospective, you can aim to set a positive tone at the start of the meeting, determine how you'll set the tone of the meeting.

> 为了在回顾会议中消除消极情绪，你可以在会议开始时设定一个积极的基调，决定你将如何设定会议的基调。

Consider asking individual team members to share their thoughts rather than posing-提出 questions to the group, or call a meeting break.

> 考虑让每个团队成员分享他们的想法，而不是向团队提出问题，或者召集会议休息。

In the upcoming activity, you'll observe Peta by reviewing the supporting materials as she navigates-处理 negative situations in the Sauce & Spoon team's retrospective.

> 在接下来的活动中，你将通过回顾Peta在Sauce & Spoon团队回顾中处理负面情况的辅助材料来观察她。

Then you'll finish your version of the retrospective.

> 然后你就可以完成你的回顾了。

After you've completed the upcoming activity, meet me in the next video to wrap up.

> 当你完成即将到来的活动后，在下一个视频中与我见面。



## Dana: Leading positive retrospectives

> Dana：领导积极的回顾会议

Hi, my name is Dana and I'm a site-站点 reliability-可靠性,可信度 manager at Google.

> 大家好，我是Dana，我是Google的站点可靠性经理。

A retrospective is a process that we go through at the end of every project where it helps us to look back and learn about the things that went well, the things that went poorly-不充分地 and where we get lucky.

> 回顾是我们在每个项目结束时都要经历的一个过程，它可以帮助我们回顾并了解哪些事情进展顺利，哪些事情进展不顺利，哪些地方我们很幸运。

It's a way for us to see if we can take the lessons that we have learned from a project, and then reuse them in the next project. 

> 对于我们来说，这是一种检验我们是否可以从一个项目中吸取经验教训，然后在下一个项目中重用它们的方法。

Most commonly, we do retrospective at the end of project.

> 最常见的是，我们在项目结束时进行回顾。

But then sometimes, if we're in the middle of the project and we find ourselves in the need to make decisions, we would collect a lot of the data that we would collect for a end of project retrospective and do that in the middle of the project.

> 但有时候，如果我们在项目中发现自己需要做决定，我们会收集很多数据这些数据是我们在项目中收集的，用于项目结束时的回顾。

Typical retrospectives have to be positive.

> 典型的回顾必须是积极的。

They have to be blameless-无可责备的,无过失的, and the goal is to continuously improve ourselves, our team, and our processes.

> 他们必须无可指责，目标是不断改进我们自己、我们的团队和我们的流程。

If we're approaching this with the correct mindset, we are asking all the people who participated in the projects what are their individual takes on their parts of the project and on the largest scale of the project, and typically, these are the people who will then be working with your next project.

> 如果我们用正确的心态来处理这个问题，我们会问所有参与项目的人，他们在项目中各自的部分和项目的最大规模上承担了什么，通常，这些人将会参与你的下一个项目。

One of the failure modes of retrospectives is when people don't really speak up, and I see that quite often at Sprint retrospectives, where people, sit there and don't say anything.

> 回顾会议的失败模式之一是人们没有真正畅所欲言，我经常在Sprint的回顾会议上看到这种情况，人们坐在那里什么也没说。

Everything is fine.

> 一切都很好。

And that might be for two main reasons.

> 这可能有两个主要原因。

One, they don't really care about improving much because it's fine.

> 第一，他们不太在乎提高多少，因为这很好。

They tolerate-忍受,包容 it.

> 他们能容忍。

It's the way that it is.

> 事情就是这样。

But the second one is the one that I am more concerned with is the lack of psychological safety when they don't feel like they can actually say what they think and have that result be well taken by the people in the room.

> 但我更关心的第二个问题是缺乏心理安全感，当他们觉得自己不能说出自己的想法并让房间里的人接受这个结果时。

We need to make sure that our team has a safe space to bring up these topics that we can actually change.

> 我们需要确保我们的团队有一个安全的空间来提出这些我们实际上可以改变的话题。

And we can change a lot of things in our day to day, in how projects are being managed, in how communication happens, and what projects we pick and choose from when we do planning on an ongoing basis.

> 我们可以在日常生活中改变很多事情，比如项目管理的方式，沟通的方式，以及我们在进行计划时选择的项目。

So making sure that these venues-发生地点 are accessible to our team members kind of assures them that they have a stake-利害关系 at what happens next.

> 因此，确保这些场所对我们的团队成员开放，就像向他们保证，他们对接下来发生的事情有利害关系。

And they can be impactful by virtue of what they say in postmortems-事后检查, because at least in the scope of the team, we will listen, we care, and you can make a difference.

> 他们在事后检查中所说的话可能会产生影响，因为至少在团队的范围内，我们会倾听，我们会关心，你可以做出改变。
