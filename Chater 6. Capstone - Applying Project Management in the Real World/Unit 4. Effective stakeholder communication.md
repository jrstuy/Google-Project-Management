# Communicating with senior stakeholders

> 与高级利益相关者沟通

## Introduction: Effective stakeholder communication

> 引言:有效的利益相关者沟通

Hey there.

In the upcoming activities we'll continue the project execution phase and then transition to the closing phase of the project life cycle.

> 在接下来的活动中，我们将继续项目执行阶段，然后过渡到项目生命周期的结束阶段。

You'll demonstrate your ability to communicate with stakeholders by writing an email about a problem to a senior stakeholder. 

> 你将通过给高级干系人写一封关于问题的电子邮件来展示你与干系人沟通的能力。

You'll also demonstrate your ability to wrap up a project by creating a closeout report to present the project impact to executive stakeholders.

> 您还将通过创建结束报告向执行干系人展示项目影响来展示您完成项目的能力。

As you've learned throughout this program, communication is a vital part of effective project management.

> 正如你在本课程中学到的，沟通是有效项目管理的重要组成部分。

That's why in the coming activities we'll have you practice observing communication between the Sauce &amp; Spoon team.

> 这就是为什么在接下来的活动中，我们会让你练习观察 the Sauce &amp; Spoon 的团队。

Based on those observations, you'll execute various communication techniques, including drafting emails to stakeholders, creating a closeout report, and writing an executive summary.

> 基于这些观察，您将执行各种沟通技巧，包括起草给利益相关者的电子邮件，创建收尾报告和编写执行摘要。

At the end of this course, you'll take what you've learned and create your own personal impact report to reflect on your experience with this program.

> 在本课程结束时，您将学习所学知识并创建自己的个人影响报告，以反映您对该计划的体验。

Ready to get started?

Meet me in the next video to discuss communicating about project problems.

> 下个视频见，讨论项目问题的沟通。



## Communicating project problems

> 沟通项目问题

Hi there.

So far in this course, you've had the chance to practice communicating about key aspects of the project like deliverables, scope, timeline, and budget.

> 到目前为止，在本课程中，您已经有机会练习沟通项目的关键方面，如可交付成果，范围，时间表和预算。

---

In this video, I'll discuss how to communicate project problems.

> 在这个视频中，我将讨论如何沟通项目问题。

In the upcoming activity you'll learn how to synthesize a project problem into a one-sentence summary for a senior stakeholder. 

> 在接下来的活动中，您将学习如何将项目问题综合为高级干系人的一句话总结。

Combining information from multiple sources like conversations, emails and documents is a skill that project managers use frequently.

> 组合来自多个来源的信息，如对话、电子邮件和文档，是项目经理经常使用的技能。

It's helpful to reference when leading conversations and meetings, writing documentation and emailing team members regarding -有关,关于 the project.

> 在领导对话和会议、撰写文档和给团队成员发送有关项目的电子邮件时，它是有帮助的。

Strong communication involves combining information and potential employers-雇主 may want you to prove-证实,证明 you're capable of doing so effectively.

> 强有力的沟通包括整合信息，潜在的雇主可能希望你证明你有能力有效地做到这一点。

The problem summary you'll write in the upcoming activity will be included in the practice email you'll create later on.

> 你将在接下来的活动中写的问题总结将包含在你稍后创建的练习电子邮件中。

---

Okay, let's discuss project problems.

> 好吧，让我们讨论一下项目问题。

Every project has its problems, and communicating those problems is a part of your job as a project manager.

> 每个项目都有自己的问题，作为项目经理，沟通这些问题是你工作的一部分。

Usually project problems are small enough to address within the immediate project team, but occasionally-偶然,偶尔 you'll need to escalate problems and propose-提议,建议 solutions to a senior stakeholder for their input and guidance on next steps.

> 通常项目问题都很小，可以直接在项目团队中解决，但偶尔你需要将问题升级，并向高级干系人提出解决方案，以获得他们对下一步的输入和指导。

Stakeholders shouldn't have to read different project documents or consult multiple email threads in order to understand the project problem.

> 干系人不应该为了理解项目问题而阅读不同的项目文档或查阅多个电子邮件线程。

Instead, it's your responsibility as a project manager to synthesize relevant information from multiple sources into a coherent-有条理的 summary that clearly communicates the issue.

> 相反，作为一个项目经理，你的责任是将来自多个来源的相关信息综合成一个清晰地传达问题的连贯总结。

To write an effective one sentence overview of a problem, you'll need to synthesize information from various sources like emails, presentations, meeting notes and more.

> 为了有效地用一句话概括一个问题，你需要综合各种来源的信息，比如电子邮件、演示文稿、会议记录等等。

Synthesizing requires gathering information from multiple sources and using those points to help form your own analysis.

> 综合需要从多个来源收集信息，并使用这些点来帮助形成自己的分析。

For example, it wouldn't be very helpful to send a stakeholder a link to your project plan, because it doesn't give them a thorough understanding of what the problem entails.

> 例如，向涉众发送项目计划的链接并不是很有帮助，因为这并不能让他们彻底了解问题的本质。

To determine which information is relevant and belongs in a one to two sentence overview for your stakeholders, ask yourself, "How can I communicate a decision in a way that makes it easy for them to decide?"

> 要确定哪些信息是相关的，并且属于一到两句话的概述，请问自己，“我如何以一种使他们更容易做出决定的方式传达决策?”

For instance, let's say the project plan has five tasks overdue because of supplier delays, and this may ultimately affect the final deliverable of your project.

> 例如，假设由于供应商的延迟，项目计划中有五个任务逾期，这可能最终会影响项目的最终可交付性。

You've been working on creating a few solutions to mitigate this issue.

> 你一直在努力创造一些解决方案来缓解这个问题。

Rather than sending your stakeholders a link to the plan and pointing out all of the overdue tasks, you might summarize the problem by telling them a number of tasks have run past their due date because of supplier issues.

> 与其向涉众发送到计划的链接并指出所有逾期的任务，不如告诉他们由于供应商问题，许多任务已经超过了到期日期，从而总结问题。

So we recommend hiring a second supplier to hit the deliverable date.

> 因此，我们建议聘请第二个供应商，以达到交付日期。

Otherwise-否则,不然, we'll need to push the launch date back.

> 否则，我们就得把发布日期往后推。

This way, you present the problem succinctly-简洁地,简便地 to your stakeholders and offer a solution.

> 通过这种方式，您可以简洁地将问题呈现给涉众并提供解决方案。

This allows stakeholders to agree with your solution, disagree with your solution or provide one of their own.

> 这允许涉众同意您的解决方案，不同意您的解决方案或提供他们自己的解决方案。

Either way, you've communicated the problem and proposed a solution, which is your role as the project manager.

> 无论哪种方式，你已经传达了问题并提出了解决方案，这就是你作为项目经理的角色。

---

Let's review.

Communicating project problems is a part of your job as a project manager.

> 沟通项目问题是项目经理工作的一部分。

It's also your responsibility to synthesize relevant information from multiple sources into a coherent-有条理的,凝聚的 summary that clearly communicates the issue.

> 你也有责任将来自多个来源的相关信息综合成一个清晰地传达问题的连贯摘要。

Synthesizing requires gathering information from multiple sources and using those points to help form your own analysis.

> 综合需要从多个来源收集信息，并使用这些点来帮助形成自己的分析。

In the upcoming activity, you'll practice communicating project problems by writing your one to two sentence overview of a problem with Sauce and Spoon tablet pilot.

> 在接下来的活动中，你将通过用 Sauce and Spoon 平板电脑试行写一到两句话的问题概述来练习交流项目问题。

You'll write this overview using information you'll synthesize from supporting materials.

> 您将使用从支持材料中合成的信息来编写这篇概述。

After you've completed the activity, meet me in the next video to learn more about project problems.

> 在你完成活动后，在下一个视频中与我见面，了解更多关于项目问题的信息。



## Chris: The art of problem-solving

> 克里斯：解决问题的艺术

Hi, my name is Chris, I'm a Program Manager Google.

> 大家好，我是Chris，我是Google的项目经理。

I work on Search, so the types of programs that I manage on Search, in particular, are building features for millions of users all around the world on many surfaces, languages and information needs of users all over the world have.

> 我从事搜索工作，所以我在搜索上管理的程序类型，特别是，正在为世界各地数百万用户在许多表面上建立功能，世界各地用户的语言和信息需求。

I can't emphasize-强调,着重 enough, "Problem solving is quintessentially-典型地,标准地 the most important thing we do as program managers. It is the job." 

> 我再怎么强调也不为过，“解决问题是我们作为项目经理最重要的事情。这就是工作。“

Whether it's a scope problem, something is out of scope or the scope is increasing or decreasing, whether it's a budgetary problem, like you don't have enough funds or too many funds, you don't have enough people, too many people, wrong skillsets of people, whether it's a timeline problem, these are all problems fundamentally that we're here to solve.

> 无论是范围问题，一些超出范围的事情还是范围在增加或减少，无论是预算问题，比如你没有足够的资金或太多的资金，你没有足够的人，太多的人，错误的技能组合，无论是时间问题，这些都是我们在这里要解决的根本问题。

Our job is to identify it, figure out a framework based on our tools, on our processes, and methodologies, **come up**-提出,想出 with a proposed-提议,建议 solution and then get buy-in for that solution.

> 我们的工作是识别它，根据我们的工具、流程和方法找出一个框架，提出一个建议的解决方案，然后获得该解决方案的支持。

The only way you're going to do that is to put something principally-主要地,大部分 and organized together with these tools, and techniques, and methods.

> 要做到这一点，唯一的方法就是用这些工具、技术和方法，把一些主要的、有组织的东西放在一起。

We try to always understand what is the root cause of the problem itself?

> 我们总是试图了解问题本身的根本原因是什么?

Typically what you're experiencing is sort of a **red herring**-转移注意力的东西 or outcome of the underlying-潜在的,表面下的 problem.

> 通常情况下，你所经历的是一种转移注意力的事情，或者是潜在问题的结果。

Always debugging-调试 the initial underlying systemic issue or the process issue or the tooling issue or the technical issue, whatever it may be, under the hood, is actually the first step.

> 总是调试最初的潜在系统问题、过程问题、工具问题或技术问题，无论它是什么，实际上是第一步。

Once you're able to identify and get enough information as to what that problem is and how you might solve it, then objectively putting a plan together based on those inputs is actually how you reach a decision which is the ultimate outcome.

> 一旦你能够识别并获得关于问题是什么以及如何解决问题的足够信息，那么基于这些输入客观地制定一个计划实际上就是你如何做出最终结果的决定。

Many times these charters or scope docs or meeting notes or trackers or documents, these artifacts that we create or we manage on a day-to-day basis as part of our job, is the job.

> 很多时候，这些章程、范围文档、会议记录、跟踪器或文档，这些我们每天创建或管理的工件，作为我们工作的一部分，就是我们的工作。

But that's actually not the job, those are just mechanisms, and tools, and methods to help you do the real job which is: running scope, running programs, convincing-说服,劝服 people, driving organizational change, solving strategic initiatives-计划,措施,倡议.

> 但那并不是你的工作，那些只是帮助你完成真正工作的机制、工具和方法，也就是:管理范围、管理项目、说服人们、推动组织变革、解决战略计划。

These things are just elements that help you navigate-处理 those problems as opposed-反抗,阻碍 to being the problems themselves.

> 这些东西只是帮助你解决问题的元素而不是问题本身。

I think that's a really important takeaway.

> 我认为这是很重要的一点。

I think this is the thing that we practice most at Google in particular is trying to solve more complex, more strategic, more holistic-整体的,全面的, larger, more complex problems on a day-to-day basis.

> 我认为这是我们在谷歌做得最多的事情，尤其是在日常工作中解决更复杂、更具战略性、更全面、更大、更复杂的问题。

If you're new to this space, you haven't had the opportunity to work on these big problems.

> 如果你是这个领域的新手，你还没有机会解决这些大问题。

How do you build that problem-solving expertise?

> 你如何建立解决问题的专业技能?

Whether it's a hobby, whether it's building a new piece of software for yourself, for your friend, whether it's another passion-激情,热情 that you have in another industry, all of these are great ways to build skills and opportunities to just solve problems.

> 无论是一种爱好，还是为自己或朋友开发一款新软件，或者是你在其他行业的另一种激情，所有这些都是培养技能和解决问题机会的好方法。

Every industry, every business has them and there are lots of ways to solve these and build those skills.

> 每个行业，每个企业都有这些问题，有很多方法可以解决这些问题，培养这些技能。



## Connecting project problems to goals

Welcome back.

In the last video, you practiced communicating project problems by writing a brief summary of an issue affecting Sauce &amp; Spoon's tablet pilot.

> 在上一个视频中，你通过写一个影响 Sauce &Spoon 的平板电脑试点。

In this video, we'll revisit a concept from a previous course on Objectives and Key Results or OKRs and their connection to projects.

> 在本视频中，我们将重新审视以前关于目标和关键结果或 OKRs 及其与项目的联系的课程中的概念。

Then in the upcoming activity, you'll connect your problem statement to Sauce &amp; Spoon's OKRs.

> 然后在接下来的活动中，你将把你的问题陈述与 Sauce &amp; Spoon's OKRs。

The ability to identify a project problems impact on your organization's OKRs will help you determine and communicate the appropriate level of risk and urgency of the problem.

> 识别项目问题对组织 OKRs 的影响的能力将帮助您确定和沟通适当的风险级别和问题的紧迫性。

Objectives and Key Results are a tool for organization-wide goal setting.

> 目标和关键结果是组织范围目标设定的工具。

OKRs combine a goal and a metric-度量 to determine a measurable outcome.

> OKRs 结合目标和度量来确定可度量的结果。

---

Let's break OKRs down.

> 让我们来分析一下 OKRs。

The objectives portion of the OKR defines what needs to be achieved, which is similar to a goal.

> OKR的目标部分定义了需要实现的内容，这与目标类似。

The key results portion of the OKR defines how an organization, team, or individual will tangibly-明白地,有形的 measure their success in meeting the objective.

> OKR 的关键结果部分定义了组织、团队或个人如何切实地衡量他们在实现目标方面的成功。

For example, one of Sauce &amp; Spoon's objectives might be to prioritize customer needs and wants.

> 例如，Sauce &Spoon 的目标可能是优先考虑客户的需求和愿望。

The key result that indicates they've reached this objective could be addressing feedback from customer reviews within 24 hours. 

> 表明他们已经达到这一目标的关键结果可能是在24小时内处理来自客户评论的反馈。

Earlier in this course, you learned that OKRs can be a helpful reference point when determining if a project goal is relevant to the needs of an organization.

> 在本课程的前面，您了解到 OKRs 在确定项目目标是否与组织的需求相关时可以是一个有用的参考点。

If a project and its goals help contribute to the larger OKRs of an organization, that's a good sign that your project is relevant and worth the time and money required to complete it.

> 如果一个项目及其目标有助于组织的更大 OKRs，这是一个好迹象，表明您的项目是相关的，值得完成它所需的时间和金钱。

OKRs can be a kind of shared language for an organization.

> OKRs 可以是组织的一种共享语言。

Here at Google, for example, every project, big or small, aims to contribute in some tangible way to our organization-wide OKRs. 

> 例如，在谷歌，每个项目，无论大小，都旨在以某种切实的方式为我们组织范围内的okr做出贡献。

Struggling to determine how a project might help us reach our OKRs can be a strong indication that we should re-evaluate the project as a whole.

> 努力确定一个项目如何帮助我们达到okr可能是一个强烈的迹象，表明我们应该从整体上重新评估项目。

OKRs can be really helpful to reference when communicating with stakeholders about project problems.

> 在与涉众就项目问题进行沟通时，okr是非常有用的参考。

You can make it clear to a stakeholder why a given problem needs to be addressed by identifying the specific ways in which that problem might impact an organization's wider OKRs.

> 您可以通过确定问题可能影响组织更广泛的 OKRs 的具体方式，向涉众清楚地说明为什么需要解决给定的问题。

You can also point to them to explain to stakeholders why a problem is worth their attention.

> 你也可以指向它们，向利益相关者解释为什么某个问题值得他们关注。

Stakeholders, especially those who hold senior positions within an organization, often have a lot of work to focus on even beyond your project.

> 涉众，尤其是那些在组织中担任高级职位的人，通常有很多工作要关注，甚至超出了您的项目。

Connecting a solution to a company's OKRs can catch-吸引 a stakeholder's limited attention.

> 将解决方案与公司的okr联系起来可能会吸引利益相关者有限的注意力。

Let's take the Sauce &amp; Spoon objective of: we seek to run an efficient, profitable-盈利的,有利可图的 business model, or we seek to prioritize our customer needs.

> 让我们来看看 Sauce &amp; Spoon 的目标:我们寻求运行一个有效的，有利可图的商业模式，或者我们寻求优先考虑我们的客户需求。

As you fine-tune-调整,微调 the problem summary you began in the previous activity, you can add a sentence to explain how the issue jeopardizes-危及,损害 the Sauce &amp; Spoon mission to run an efficient business model and meet customer needs.

> 当您对前一活动中开始的问题摘要进行微调时，您可以添加一个句子来解释该问题如何危及 Sauce &amp; Spoon 的使命是运行高效的商业模式并满足客户需求。

---

Let's review.

In this video, you reviewed OKRs or Objectives and Key Results, defined OKRs as a tool for organization-wide goal setting, and learned how they're helpful when communicating with stakeholders about project problems.

> 在本视频中，您回顾了 OKRs 或目标和关键结果，将 OKRs 定义为组织范围内目标设置的工具，并了解了它们在与利益相关者就项目问题进行沟通时如何发挥作用。

In the upcoming activity, you'll practice drawing connections between OKRs and project problems.

> 在接下来的活动中，你将练习绘制 OKRs 和项目问题之间的联系。

You'll use what you learn from the supporting materials to write a sentence that connects your problem summary with Sauce &amp; Spoon's OKRs.

> 你将使用你从辅助材料中学到的东西来写一个句子，将你的问题总结与 Sauce &amp; Spoon's  OKRs。

After you've completed the activity, meet me in the next video where we'll discuss composing-撰写,组成,构成 emails to senior stakeholders.

> 完成活动后，在下一个视频中与我见面，我们将讨论给高级干系人编写电子邮件。



## Writing emails to escalate a problem

> 写邮件升级问题

In the last video, we did a quick review of objectives and key results.

> 在上一个视频中，我们快速回顾了目标和关键结果。

We also discussed how connecting a project problem to an organization's OKRs can help convince-说服,劝服 a stakeholder to take that problem seriously-认真地,严重地.

> 我们还讨论了如何将项目问题与组织的okr联系起来，以帮助说服涉众认真对待该问题。

In this video, we'll review a few best practices for writing emails to get decisions you need from stakeholders.

> 在这个视频中，我们将回顾一些写电子邮件的最佳实践，以便从利益相关者那里得到你需要的决定。

---

As a project manager, identifying, and managing issues is part of the job.

> 作为项目经理，识别和管理问题是工作的一部分。

If an issue is big enough to escalate to a senior stakeholder, then it's probably-可能,大概,或许 an issue you're hoping to resolve as soon as possible.

> 如果一个问题大到足以升级到高级利益相关者，那么这个问题可能是你希望尽快解决的。

Email can be an effective tool for quickly escalating a problem and asking for a decision from a stakeholder on how to proceed-进行. 

> 电子邮件是一种有效的工具，可以快速升级问题，并要求利益相关者就如何进行决策。

That's why it's really important to ensure that your email is written in a way that effectively captures a stakeholder's attention and gets you the response you need.

> 这就是为什么确保你的电子邮件的写作方式能够有效地吸引利益相关者的注意力，并得到你所需要的回应，这一点非常重要。

---

There are a few best practices to keep in mind to make sure your email doesn't get ignored.

> 这里有一些最好的做法，以确保你的电子邮件不会被忽略。

First, think about what's most important to your stakeholder.

> 首先，想想对你的利益相关者来说什么是最重要的。

Often senior stakeholders will be more interested in a problem's potential impact on an organization than its impact on a single project.

> 通常，高级干系人对问题对组织的潜在影响比对单个项目的影响更感兴趣。

This is where connecting project problems to an organization's OKRs comes in handy.

> 这就是将项目问题与组织的 OKRs 联系起来的地方。

Identify how a problem will impact your organization as a whole, and ensure that you clearly communicate that impact within the first two sentences of your email.

> 确定一个问题将如何影响整个组织，并确保在邮件的前两句话中清楚地传达这种影响。

Once you've determined what's most important to your stakeholder, you'll be better prepared to draft an effective email. 

> 一旦你确定了对你的利益相关者来说什么是最重要的，你就可以更好地准备起草一封有效的电子邮件。

Remember to write a clear subject line-行 that briefly states what your email is about.

> 记得写一个清晰的主题行，简要地说明你的邮件是关于什么的。

It's also helpful to include language in your subject line that indicates what you'd like your stakeholder to do upon reading your email.

> 在邮件的主题行中加入一些语言，表明你希望你的利益相关者在阅读你的邮件时做些什么，这也很有帮助。

Do you need them to review a document you've attached-附加 to the email?

> 您是否需要他们审阅您在邮件中附加的文件?

Try adding the words, please review, to your subject line.

> 试着在邮件的主题行加上“请复习”这样的字眼。

Is this an urgent email that you need a quick response to?

> 这是一封需要你快速回复的紧急邮件吗?

Then you might try adding the word, urgent, to the subject line.

> 然后你可以试着在邮件的主题行加上“紧急”这个词。

Stakeholders, especially those who hold senior positions within an organization, usually receive many emails throughout the day, including terms like urgent, timely, decision needed, or please review, can help draw attention to your message and make clear the action you'd like your stakeholder to take.

> 利益相关者，尤其是那些在组织中担任高级职位的人，通常会在一天中收到许多电子邮件，其中包括紧急、及时、需要决策或请审查等术语，这些术语可以帮助吸引人们对你的信息的关注，并明确你希望利益相关者采取的行动。

Remember to also keep the body of the email brief and **to the point**-切中要害.

> 记住，邮件的正文也要简明扼要。

When communicating about a project problem to a busy senior stakeholder, your email should briefly outline the problem, explain how it might impact an organization's goals, and clearly state the decision you need from your stakeholder in order to proceed.

> 当与一个忙碌的高级干系人沟通项目问题时，你的电子邮件应该简要概述问题，解释它可能如何影响组织的目标，并清楚地说明你需要从干系人那里得到的决定，以便继续进行。

That's it.

> 就这样。

Write one or two sentences that summarize your problem along with another sentence that identifies how the problem may impact your organization's OKRs.

> 用一两句话概括你的问题，再用另一句话说明这个问题如何影响你的组织的 OKRs。

If there are documents or additional information that your stakeholder might need to review to make an informed decision, consider including hyperlinks or attachments with the information in your email.

> 如果你的利益相关者可能需要查看文件或其他信息来做出明智的决定，考虑在你的电子邮件中包含超链接或附件。

Once you've finished writing your email, be sure to proofread-校对,校阅 it for misspellings-拼错, grammatical-语法的 errors, and inaccurate hyperlinks. 

> 一旦你写完你的电子邮件，一定要校对拼写错误，语法错误，和不准确的超链接。

Use spellcheck and other grammar check functions in your email application or online to help you make sure everything looks good.

> 使用拼写检查和其他语法检查功能在您的电子邮件应用程序或在线，以帮助您确保一切看起来不错。

---

Let's review.

When writing an email to stakeholders, make sure to do the following.

> 在给利益相关者写电子邮件时，请确保做到以下几点。

Think about what's most important to your stakeholder.

> 想想对你的股东来说什么是最重要的。

Write a clear subject line, keep the body of the email brief, and proofread-校对,校阅 for misspellings, grammatical errors, and inaccurate hyperlinks.

> 写一个清晰的主题，保持邮件正文简短，并校对拼写错误，语法错误和不准确的超链接。

Someday, when you have to communicate issues to stakeholders in real-life situations, you'll see how managing, tracking, and communicating project problems is a huge part of running the project.

> 有一天，当您必须在现实生活中与涉众沟通问题时，您将看到管理、跟踪和沟通项目问题是运行项目的重要组成部分。

In the upcoming activity, you'll apply email writing best practices when you compose-撰写 an email to a stakeholder of the sauce and spoon tablet pilot.

> 在接下来的活动中，你将应用电子邮件写作的最佳实践，当你写一封电子邮件给 sauce & spoon 平板电脑试点项目的利益相关者。



## Laura: Stakeholder communication best practices

> Laura：利益相关者沟通的最佳实践

I'm Laura, the Executive Productivity Advisor-顾问 at Google.

> 我是劳拉，谷歌的执行生产力顾问。

My role is to work one on one with executives in a coaching-教练 format in order to help them with time management, meeting management, effective email, communication and organization.

> 我的职责是以教练的形式与高管们一对一地工作，以帮助他们进行时间管理、会议管理、有效的电子邮件、沟通和组织。

When you're communicating with a stakeholder, you really want to think about the absolute important information that they need to see.

> 当你与利益相关者沟通时，你真的想要考虑他们需要看到的绝对重要的信息。

So you might give more details when you're speaking with a coworker or a teammate.

> 所以当你和同事或队友交谈时，你可能会给出更多的细节。

But when you're summarizing for an executive-主管, you really want to make sure you keep it concise.

> 但当你为高管做总结时，你一定要确保简洁。

You want to do some work beforehand-事先 to figure out what's the best way to get them information or to get a decision from them. 

> 你需要事先做一些工作，找出获得信息或从他们那里得到决定的最佳方式。

Some things that can be helpful with that is asking someone like their executive assistant-助理,助手, or someone that's worked with them before, asking them what is their preferred communication style?

> 有些事情可能会有所帮助，比如问他们的行政助理，或者以前和他们一起工作过的人，问他们喜欢的沟通方式是什么?

What types of presentations do they like to see?

> 他们喜欢看什么样的演讲?

What information do they typically need in order to make decisions?

> 他们通常需要什么信息来做决定?

And by doing that, work ahead of time and asking around, you're setting yourself up for success, especially if you only have a limited amount of time or a short amount of communication that you're able to get to the stakeholder.

> 通过这样做，提前工作并询问周围的人，你为自己的成功做好了准备，特别是如果你只有有限的时间或很少的沟通，你就能和利益相关者取得联系。

It's important to remember that while you have multiple stakeholders or different projects, it is going to be different how each of them like to communicate or like to receive information.

> 重要的是要记住，当你有多个干系人或不同的项目时，他们每个人喜欢沟通或喜欢接收信息的方式将是不同的。

One example is: I worked with a couple of managers on a project, and both of them were stakeholders.

> 一个例子是:我在一个项目中与几个经理一起工作，他们都是利益相关者。

One was very talkative-爱说话的,健谈的 and love to brainstorm through things.

> 一个非常健谈，喜欢集思广益。

He wanted meetings with me pretty frequently, and he wanted to hash out all of the details.

> 他想经常和我见面，他想讨论所有的细节。

The other stakeholder was completely the opposite-相反的, thinking about how to tailor-迎合,使适应 the same information, the same decision making process to each person that you need information or stakeholder that you're working with is really helpful and important to remember.

> 另一个利益相关者则完全相反，考虑如何为你需要的每个人定制相同的信息，相同的决策过程或者与你一起工作的利益相关者，这真的很有帮助，也很重要。

I like to look at a presentation I'm giving to a stakeholder and think, what are the probably the five questions they're going to ask me?

> 我喜欢看着我给利益相关者做的演示，然后思考，他们可能会问我的五个问题是什么?

And then I have that additional detail in the appendix are ready to go so that I'm able to make the most of their time.

> 然后我在附录中准备了额外的细节，这样我就能充分利用他们的时间。

---

Another good tip is when you come to a stakeholder with a problem or an issue, you also come with your proposed solution or possible solutions, thinking about not just asking, what do I do?

> 另一个好建议是，当你带着问题或问题去找利益相关者时，你也要带着你提出的解决方案或可能的解决方案，不要只想着问，我该怎么办?

But saying, I think maybe we should do A, but we could also do B and C.

> 但是，我认为也许我们应该做A，但我们也可以做B和C。

What do you think?

> 你认为怎么样？

That gives them a starting point and they feel like you've done the background work and you know the problem really well.

> 这给了他们一个起点，他们会觉得你已经做了背景工作，你对问题非常了解。

If you're sending an update via email, you really want to make sure, just like a meeting, that you're using the email in the best way possible.

> 如果你通过电子邮件发送更新，你真的想确保，就像开会一样，你以最好的方式使用电子邮件。

Something I like to do and that we do often at Google is called TLDR at the top, which means too long didn't read.

> 我喜欢做的事情，我们在谷歌经常做的事情，在顶部被称为TLDR，意思是太长不读。

It's kind of a funny way of saying there may be a lot of information, but here's the one sentence you need to know from the email.

> 这是一种有趣的说法，可能有很多信息，但这是你需要从电子邮件中知道的一句话。

So having some sort of summary at the top similar to that, saying, here's an update on project A or need decision or action requested or deadline by, that type of communication right up front gives the stakeholder the ability to know what's coming in the email.

> 所以在顶部有一些类似的总结，说，这是项目A的最新情况，或者需要决定或要求采取的行动或截止日期，这种类型的沟通可以让利益相关者知道电子邮件中的内容。

Then you want to think about how to be as concise as possible when you're developing the email, so using things like bullets, highlighting or bolding, things that need to pop out to them, reiterating-重申,反复说 your ask at the end of the email, including any sort of deadlines that you have.

> 然后你要考虑如何在写邮件的时候尽可能地简洁，所以使用项目符号，突出显示或粗体，需要突出的东西，在邮件末尾重申你的要求，包括任何你的截止日期。

That's really helpful so that if people are scanning or if they go back to read your email, they have all the information that they need, including links, attachments, make it as easy as possible for them to go through your email and reply-回答,答复 to you with the information that you need.

> 这是非常有用的，如果人们浏览或者回去阅读你的邮件，他们会有他们需要的所有信息，包括链接和附件，让他们尽可能容易地浏览你的邮件，并回复你需要的信息。



# Demonstrating impact

> 展示影响

## Completing a closeout-收尾 report

> 完成收尾报告

Hello there.

By now you've been with Peta through some of the most essential pieces of managing and delivering a project.

> 到目前为止，您已经与Peta一起经历了管理和交付项目的一些最重要的部分。

You followed her as she set goals, navigated through the planning process, managed quality, escalated issues to stakeholders and more.

> 你跟随她设定目标，引导计划流程，管理质量，向利益相关者升级问题等等。

Great work.

We've reached the point in the project where Sauce and Spoon has launched the tablets after passing quality standards and most of the project manager's work is done.

> 在这个项目中，Sauce and Spoon 已经在通过质量标准后发布了平板电脑，项目经理的大部分工作也已经完成。 

In this video, we'll discuss one of the last elements of project management: closing out the project and showcasing its impact. 

> 在本视频中，我们将讨论项目管理的最后一个要素:结束项目并展示其影响。

Before Peta can consider her project completed, she has a few more tasks to **take care of**-处理,办理.

> 在Peta认为她的项目完成之前，她还有一些任务需要处理。

---

One of those tasks is to create a closeout report.

> 其中一项任务是创建收尾报告。

The closeout report is a great opportunity to compile-汇编,收集 all links and documentation into one place, a practice we like to call: good project hygiene-卫生.

> 收尾报告是将所有链接和文档汇编到一个地方的好机会，我们喜欢称之为:良好的项目卫生。

The closeout report is also a time for reflection on your team's performance, and it helps your team ensure every task was completed.

> 收尾报告也是反思团队表现的时候，它可以帮助团队确保完成每一项任务。

A closeout report confirms the project is done, summarizes deliverables, success metrics, feedback, lessons learned and next steps and serves as a reference document for the organization.

> 收尾报告确认项目已经完成，总结了可交付成果、成功指标、反馈、经验教训和后续步骤，并作为组织的参考文件。

If a follow up project is required or a similar project is initiated, having these artifacts in one place will help these future projects run smoothly and should another similar project occur, future project managers will be set up for success if they have meticulous-细致,细腻 information on past projects.

> 如果需要一个后续项目或启动一个类似的项目，将这些工件放在一个地方将有助于这些未来的项目顺利运行，并且如果另一个类似的项目发生，如果未来的项目经理对过去的项目有细致的信息，他们将为成功做好准备。

An effective closeout report helps ensure that everyone is satisfied with the work that was done, finalizes the efforts of the team and lets people move on to new projects and tasks, and increases the impact of the team's work through communication with other people who may not have been as involved in the project.

> 有效的结束报告有助于确保每个人都对所完成的工作感到满意，完成团队的努力，并让人们继续进行新的项目和任务，并通过与其他可能没有参与项目的人进行沟通来增加团队工作的影响。

In addition to serving as a reference document for the organization, a project closeout report is a document created by project managers for project managers, future project managers and anyone interested in the project elements and artifacts.

> 除了作为组织的参考文档之外，项目收尾报告是由项目经理为项目经理、未来的项目经理以及对项目元素和工件感兴趣的任何人创建的文档。

Ideally, you want anyone unfamiliar with the project to be able to read it and get a full understanding of what the project was, why it was done and how well the project went.

> 理想情况下，您希望任何不熟悉项目的人都能够阅读它，并充分了解项目是什么，为什么要这样做以及项目进展如何。

In fact, the project closeout report you will complete in this course should be able to stand alone for your potential employers. 

> 事实上，你将在本课程中完成的项目总结报告应该能够独立于你的潜在雇主。

You should be able to give them this document as a sample of your work.

> 你应该能够给他们这份文件作为你工作的样本。

They should understand the context of the Sauce and Spoon tablet roll out project and get a demonstration-演示,展示 of your ability to synthesize and communicate information clearly.

> 他们应该了解 Sauce and Spoon 平板电脑推出项目的背景，并清楚地展示你综合和沟通信息的能力。

---

In a project closeout report, you'll start by adding your project summary.

> 在项目结尾报告中，您将首先添加项目摘要。

In this section, you'll need to include the objectives.

> 在本节中，您需要包括目标。

Another way to think about this is: What was the desired result for this project?

> 考虑这个问题的另一种方式是：这个项目的期望结果是什么?

Next is methodology or approach.

> 接下来是方法论或方法。

Make sure to denote-表示 which methodology or approach your team used.

> 确保指出您的团队使用的方法或方法。

Is your team using Waterfall, Agile, Lean, maybe a combination of these or something else?

> 你的团队是在使用瀑布式、敏捷式、精益式，还是这些方法的组合?

One of the most important aspects of the closeout report is the performance baseline.

> 结帐报告中最重要的一个方面是绩效基线。

Here, you'll describe the actual results and compare them to the objectives laid out in the planning and execution phases.

> 在这里，您将描述实际结果，并将其与计划和执行阶段制定的目标进行比较。

You'll compare specifications like actual project schedule versus planned project schedule, actual project cost versus planned project cost and plan scope versus delivered scope.

> 你将比较实际项目进度与计划项目进度、实际项目成本与计划项目成本、计划范围与交付范围等规格。

There's even a handy notes column so you can explain any discrepancies-差异,不符 or issues that arose-出现,引发.

> 甚至还有一个方便的笔记栏，这样你就可以解释出现的任何差异或问题。

The remaining sections are Key Accomplishments and Outcomes, Lessons Learned, Next Steps and Project Documentation Archive.

> 其余部分是主要成就和成果、经验教训、下一步和项目文档档案。

When filling out these sections, being thorough is key.

> 在填写这些部分时，要彻底。

We've included questions to help guide you and ensure you're being detailed enough.

> 我们包含了一些问题来帮助指导你，并确保你写得足够详细。

But feel free to take it one step further in your own closeouts by getting even more specific.

> 但在你自己的收尾中，你也可以通过更具体的方式更进一步。

And when you're filling out these sections, keep in mind that the purpose of the closeout is to compile and archive the most important aspects of the project.

> 当您填写这些部分时，请记住收尾的目的是编译和存档项目中最重要的方面。

---

Let's review.

When writing a project closeout, make sure to include the following: project summary, methodology, performance baseline, outcomes, lessons learned next steps and add a project documentation archive.

> 在撰写项目总结时，请确保包括以下内容:项目总结、方法、绩效基线、结果、吸取的经验教训和后续步骤，并添加项目文档存档。

Hopefully, I've explained just how important to closeout report is for a project.

> 希望我已经解释了结帐报告对项目的重要性。

If a project is repeated, or a similar project is initiated, this important documentation, which includes your learnings and project outcomes, will set future project managers up for success.

> 如果一个项目被重复，或者一个类似的项目被启动，这个重要的文档，包括你的学习和项目结果，将为未来的项目经理的成功奠定基础。

In the next activity, you'll review supporting materials to finish a close out report for the Sauce and Spoon tablet pilot.

> 在接下来的活动中，您将审阅辅助材料，完成 Sauce&Spoon 平板电脑试点项目的收尾报告。



## Project impact report

> 项目影响报告

In the last video and activity, you learned about keeping good project hygiene by creating a project closeout report.

> 在上一个视频和活动中，您学习了如何通过创建项目收尾报告来保持良好的项目卫生。

Now we'll discuss a similar concept called impact reporting, and you'll learn how to write an executive summary.

> 现在我们将讨论一个类似的概念，称为影响报告，您将学习如何编写执行总结。

---

The purpose of creating an impact report is to show others the value that's been added to your project.

> 创建影响报告的目的是向其他人展示您的项目所增加的价值。

Usually it's in the form of a presentation guided by a deck-甲板 or slideshow you've created.

> 通常是以演示的形式，由您创建的甲板或幻灯片引导。

Unlike a detailed closeout report that's designed for future project managers or other readers interested in the project details, an impact report is typically created for senior stakeholders or project sponsors who weren't involved in the day-to-day details of the project.

> 与为未来的项目经理或其他对项目细节感兴趣的读者设计的详细收尾报告不同，影响报告通常是为高级利益相关者或项目发起人创建的，他们不参与项目的日常细节。

---

Reporting your project impact is key for a few reasons.

> 报告项目影响是关键，原因如下。

It can help you to analyze results to adapt and improve services.

> 它可以帮助您分析结果，以适应和改进服务。

Motivate staff and senior stakeholders by celebrating achievements-成绩,成就.

> 通过庆祝成就来激励员工和高级利益相关者。

Build trust and credibility-信誉,可靠性,可信度 with supporters, sponsors, funders, and anyone benefiting from the project.

> 与支持者、赞助者、资助者和任何从项目中受益的人建立信任和信誉。

Share lessons with similar organizations.

> 与类似的组织分享经验。

---

Let's get into the elements that should go into an impact report.

> 让我们来看看影响报告中应该包含的元素。

One of the most important pieces of an impact report is the executive summary.

> 影响报告中最重要的部分之一是执行总结。

It's where you can highlight the key points of the project for your stakeholders.

> 在这里，你可以向涉众强调项目的关键点。

An executive summary is a few sentences to a paragraph that describe the project's purpose and outcome.

> 执行总结是用几句话到一段话来描述项目的目的和结果。

It provides an overview of the main points of a larger report.

> 它概述了一份大型报告的要点。

It's written to share with the stakeholders who might not have time to review the entire report.

> 它是为了与可能没有时间审查整个报告的利益相关者分享而编写的。

Think of the executive summary as a **highlight reel**-高能时刻 for your project.

> 将执行总结视为项目的亮点。

The purpose is to give senior stakeholders a concise and strong description of positive outcomes within the project without giving them too much information or being too vague-模糊的,不明确的.

> 目的是给高级干系人一个简洁有力的项目积极成果的描述，而不是给他们太多的信息或太模糊。

When creating an executive summary, ask yourself this question.

> 在创建执行总结时，问自己这个问题。

If an executive didn't have time to read all of the project documentation and only had time to read this executive summary, would they be able to understand the project highlights?

> 如果执行人员没有时间阅读所有的项目文档，而只有时间阅读这个执行摘要，他们能够理解项目的重点吗?

Your executive summary should aim to answer questions like: how effectively was the project delivered and what did we learn from it?

> 你的执行摘要应该旨在回答这样的问题:项目交付的效率如何?我们从中学到了什么?

In addition to asking yourself some foundational questions, it's a good idea to review your smart goals, your business case, and your project charter to help you write the executive summary.

> 除了问自己一些基本的问题外，回顾你的明智的目标、你的商业案例和你的项目章程是一个好主意，以帮助你编写执行总结。

These will help you reflect on and identify the most important aspects of your project, which are likely tied to key accomplishments and positive outcomes.

> 这将帮助你反思并确定项目中最重要的方面，这些方面可能与关键成就和积极成果有关。

One useful tip you might find helpful when creating an executive summary is to actually draft the rest of the impact report first. 

> 在创建执行总结时，您可能会发现一个有用的提示是先实际起草影响报告的其余部分。

This will help you hone-磨练,训练 in on the most relevant information to include in your summary.

> 这将帮助你在总结中找到最相关的信息。

In this impact report template, you'll see slides for results, what worked, and next steps.

> 在此影响报告模板中，您将看到有关结果、工作方法和后续步骤的幻灯片。

In these slides, you should aim to describe your project in detail using things like graphs and images where applicable to tell the story of the project success.

> 在这些幻灯片中，你应该详细地描述你的项目，在合适的情况下使用图表和图像来讲述项目成功的故事。

The more detailed you get in these slides, the easier it'll be to pull out and identify the highlights and add them to your executive summary.

> 这些幻灯片越详细，就越容易找出重点，并将其添加到执行摘要中。

After you've drafted those sections of the impact report, you're ready to draft the executive summary.

> 在你起草了影响报告的这些部分之后，你就可以开始起草执行总结了。

---

You'll want to include elements of the following information: project vision.

> 您将需要包括以下信息的元素:项目愿景。

Here you'll specify what the purpose of your report was.

> 在这里，您将指定报告的目的是什么。

What need is the project fulfilling-实现,履行?

> 项目满足了什么需求?

Key accomplishments.

> 关键成就。

This is your opportunity to discuss which activities, tasks, and milestones helped you to find success.

> 这是你讨论哪些活动、任务和里程碑帮助你找到成功的机会。

---

What are the main highlights of the impact report?

> 影响报告的主要重点是什么?

Did your project increase profitability-盈利能力?

> 你的项目是否增加了盈利能力?

What value did the project add?

> 这个项目增加了什么价值?

Talk about those here.

> 在这里讨论这些。

Lessons learned.

> 吸取教训。

This is where you'll talk about potential improvements.

> 这是你谈论潜在改进的地方。

How will you change future processes for the better?

> 您将如何使未来的流程变得更好?

---

Let's explore an example of an executive summary.

> 让我们来看一个执行总结的例子。

Say you just completed a project to launch a new money saving app that automatically sends money from its users **checking accounts**-支票账户 into designated-指定,任命 savings accounts bi-monthly.

> 假设你刚刚完成了一个项目，推出了一个新的储蓄应用程序，它可以每两个月自动从用户的支票账户转账到指定的储蓄账户。

The amount sent from checking to savings is determined by how much money you have in your checking account at the time of withdrawal plus a few other variables-变量, like the frequency-频率 of deposits-存款.

> 从支票账户转到储蓄账户的金额取决于你在取钱时支票账户里有多少钱，再加上一些其他变量，比如存款的频率。

Your beta users loved the app because it helped them build a savings account without even thinking about it.

> 你的测试用户喜欢这款应用，因为它帮助他们不假思索地建立了一个储蓄账户。

Let's start with our project's vision.

> 让我们从项目愿景开始。

It might say something like, our goal is to help users get ahead-领先 financially-财政上,金融上 by creating an algorithm-based automatic deposit system that pulls money into a savings account.

> 让我们从项目愿景开始。它可能会说，我们的目标是通过创建一个基于算法的自动存款系统来帮助用户在财务上取得领先，该系统可以将钱存入储蓄账户。

Now let's talk about what the project accomplished.

> 现在让我们谈谈这个项目完成了什么。

These are your key accomplishments, so you might say, as we prepared to launch, we helped 1,000 beta users save over $300,000 in just six months.

> 这些都是你的主要成就，所以你可能会说，当我们准备发行时，我们帮助1000名测试用户在短短6个月内节省了30多万美元。

This proved the use case and need for our app.

> 这证明了我们的应用的用例和需求。

In key accomplishments, you might also want to include financial highlights.

> 在主要成就中，你可能还需要包括经济方面的亮点。

So we could say something like, by charging-收费 users three dollars per month with 1,000 users in six months, we netted $18,000. 

> 所以我们可以这样说，通过向用户收取每月3美元的费用，在6个月内拥有1000名用户，我们净赚了18000美元。

Finally, it's good to talk about what things could have been done differently.

> 最后，我们应该谈谈哪些事情本来可以做得不一样。

Include lessons learned by saying something like, the main feedback received from our beta testing was that our users wanted more frequent updates about when their money was being transferred.

> 我们从 beta 测试中得到的主要反馈是，我们的用户希望更频繁地了解他们的资金何时被转移。

We'll add that in our update.

> 我们将在更新中添加它。

---

Let's review the main ideas we've covered in this video.

> 让我们回顾一下本视频中涉及的主要思想。

Reporting your impact can help you to analyze results to adapt and improve services, motivate staff and senior stakeholders through celebrating achievements, build trust and credibility-信誉 with supporters, sponsors, funders and those benefiting from the project, and share lessons with similar organizations.

> 报告您的影响可以帮助您分析结果以调整和改进服务，通过庆祝成就来激励员工和高级利益相关者，与支持者、赞助商、资助者和项目受益者建立信任和信誉，并与类似组织分享经验教训。

We also covered executive summaries and how they're essential to highlighting the key elements of your project to stakeholders. 

> 我们还介绍了执行总结，以及它们如何在向涉众突出项目的关键要素方面发挥重要作用。

Now that you've got a better idea of what an impact report might entail, it's time to write your own executive summary.

> 现在你已经对影响报告的内容有了更好的了解，是时候写你自己的执行总结了。

We've built out an impact report so you can get a sense of what a typical report might look like.

> 我们已经建立了一个影响报告，这样你就可以了解一个典型的报告可能是什么样子的。

All you have to do is fill in the executive summary based on your new insights.

> 你所要做的就是根据你的新见解填写执行摘要。

# Preparing for an interview

> 面试准备

## Acing an elevator-电梯 pitch

> 电梯演讲技巧

If you've been following along throughout the entire program, I hope you're excited to update your resume-简历,履历, explore your target role, and build your professional-职业的,专业的 network.

> 如果你一直在跟进整个项目，我希望你会很兴奋地更新你的简历，探索你的目标职位，并建立你的职业网络。

Your next step is to prepare for the job interview.

> 下一步就是为面试做准备。

First, we'll discuss how to create an elevator pitch you can use for different situations during your job search.

> 首先，我们将讨论如何创建一个电梯游说，你可以在不同的情况下使用你的求职。

Chances are you've heard the phrase "tell me about yourself."

> 你可能听过“介绍一下你自己”这句话。

For situations like this, it's helpful to come up with an elevator pitch that can lead you into a longer conversation about your experience and reveal opportunities for your next step.

> 在这种情况下，想出一个电梯演讲是很有帮助的，它可以引导你进入一个关于你的经历的更长时间的谈话，并揭示你下一步的机会。

An elevator pitch is a quick professional summary of yourself, typically, it's designed for you to present-展示,表现 in 60 seconds or less. 

> 电梯演讲是对你自己的快速专业总结，通常，它是为你在60秒或更短的时间内呈现而设计的。

Conveniently-便利地,合宜地 the time it may take for you to go up from the first floor of a building to the 50th.

> 很巧的是，你从一栋楼的一层爬到50层所花的时间。

Over the years, my elevator pitch has changed dramatically-剧烈地,明显地, I used to think that I needed to have the most polished-完美 pitch.

> 多年来，我的电梯演讲发生了巨大的变化，我曾经认为我需要最完美的演讲。

But over time, what I found is that my elevator pitch needed to be the most authentic-真实的,可靠的.

> 但随着时间的推移，我发现我的电梯演讲需要是最真实的。

For instance, I used to say things like, I love project management, because I like to make order out of chaos-混乱,混沌, which is true, but generic.

> 例如，我曾经说过这样的话，我喜欢项目管理，因为我喜欢在混乱中建立秩序，这是真的，但一般。

Today I say I don't just love project management, but I'm in love with project management, which is also true, because I help make dreams come to life.

> 今天，我说我不仅喜欢项目管理，而且我爱上了项目管理，这也是真的，因为我帮助梦想成真。

So as you're preparing your elevator pitch, it's helpful to **come up with**-想出,提出 an authentic story about your passion and why project management excites you.

> 因此，当你准备电梯演讲时，想出一个真实的故事来描述你的激情，以及为什么项目管理让你兴奋，这是很有帮助的。

Really take time to think about why you want a specific type of role, or what draws-吸引 you to a specific industry;

> 花点时间想想为什么你想要一个特定类型的职位，或者是什么吸引你进入这个特定的行业;

---

What genuinely-真诚地,的确 excites you about the job?

> 这份工作真正让你兴奋的是什么?

These are the details that make for a great elevator pitch.

> 这些细节构成了一场精彩的电梯游说。

To craft a strong elevator pitch, break it down into three parts: who you are, what skills and experiences you have, and what you want.

> 要制作一个强有力的电梯演讲，将其分为三个部分:你是谁，你拥有什么技能和经验，你想要什么。

Start with who you are, introduce yourself and speak in a conversational-对话 tone.

> 从你是谁开始，介绍自己，用对话的语气说话。

For example, you might say something like: I started my career in project management a few years ago.

> 例如，你可以这样说:我几年前开始从事项目管理工作。

And recently, I've been drawn to the gaming space.

> 最近，我被游戏领域所吸引。

I've always been good at bringing people together and working towards common goals.

To ensure we would meet our timeline, I took a look at the sign-off process and noticed it called for hundreds of terms-条款,条件, documents, pamphlets-小册子, and video reviews that had to be signed off by every person in the team.

> 为了确保我们能够满足我们的时间表，我查看了签署过程，并注意到它需要数百个条款，文件，小册子和视频评论，必须由团队中的每个人签署。

This wasn't the appropriate level of detail needed from these stakeholders, or a valuable use of their time.

> 这不是这些涉众所需要的适当的细节级别，也不是对他们时间的有价值的利用。

I summarized the areas of concern and opportunity that the stakeholders needed to approve and created a condensed-浓缩 review process.

It won't be a strong interview if you're simply reading from a scenario, you had pre-written.

The best advice here is to prepare, whether you're talking to someone over the phone, or over a video call, spend some time getting comfortable, and practicing in advance, so you feel more confident when the interviewer starts.
