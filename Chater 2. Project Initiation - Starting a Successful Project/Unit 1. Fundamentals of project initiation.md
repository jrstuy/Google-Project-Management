**Helpful habits to successfully complete the certificate**

As a learner, you’re bringing all of your past experiences and best learning practices to this program. The designers of this course have also put together a list of helpful habits that they believe will help you to be successful: 

1. **Plan your time:** Setting regular study times and sticking with them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar or timetable to create a schedule, and list what you plan to do each day in order to break your work down into achievable goals. Create a quiet place to watch the videos, review the readings, and complete the activities so you can really focus on the material.
2. **Be curious:** If you find an idea that gets you excited, act on it! Ask questions, search for more details online, check out the links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The little things you do to support your learning along the way will take your knowledge even further, open more doors in this high-growth field, and help you qualify for jobs. 
3. **Take notes:** Notes are useful-to-remember information that you think might be important in the future, especially as you’re preparing to enter a new job field. In addition, taking notes is an effective way to make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of those topics.
4. **Chat (responsibly) with other learners**: If you have a question, chances are, you’re not alone. Reach out in the [discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-initiation-google/discussions) to ask for help from other learners taking this program. You can also visit Coursera’s[ Global Online Community](https://coursera.community/). Other important things to know while you’re making friends can be found in the [Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) and [Code of Conduct](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208280036-Coursera-Code-of-Conduct).
5. **Update your profile**: Consider [updating your profile](https://www.coursera.org/account/profile) on Coursera. This link appears in the menu when you click on your name at the top-right corner of this screen. When classmates find you in the discussion forums, they can click on your name to view your profile and get to know you more.

**Finding more information**

Throughout this course, you will learn the basics of project management. We will provide a lot of information through videos and readings. But sometimes, you may need to look things up on your own for additional learning. Things change fast in this growing field, so it is critical to do your own research so you can stay up-to-date on what is new. 

Here are some helpful project management resources available online:

- The [Project Management Institute](https://www.pmi.org/) is the leading association for those in project, program, or portfolio management professions. Their website provides guides, industry standards, articles, templates, job boards, certifications, and more to help support professionals in these careers.
- The [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/index.html) defines Scrum, a technique used in Agile project management. You’ll learn about this framework later in the program. This guide describes Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together. You can also find hundreds of free resources to learn more about Scrum at [Scrum.org Resources](https://www.scrum.org/resources).

**Digital documents, spreadsheets, and presentations** 

You will complete activities using a variety of digital documents, spreadsheets, and presentation templates. These templates align with the document types that project managers often use to create, edit, and collaborate with their team and organization. Digital documents make it easy to collaborate in real time and stay organized.

If you’re not familiar with these types of tools, check out the course [Resources](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-initiation-google/resources/VQqFi). 

**Glossary**

This course will cover a lot of terms and concepts, some of which you may already know and some of which will be new. To remind yourself about what a term means, refer to this [Glossary](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-initiation-google/resources/r3bQY).

# Understanding the key components of project initiation

> 了解项目启动的关键组成部分

## Why is project initiation essential-必要的,必不可少的?

> 为什么项目启动是必要的?

Welcome back! 

In the last course, you learned that initiation is the first phase within the project life cycle, followed by planning, executing, and closing.

Makes sense-道理, right?

> 很有道理，对吧?

Regardless-不管怎样,无论如何 of your chosen-挑选出来的 methodology, all projects have to start somewhere.

> 无论您选择何种方法，所有项目都必须从某个地方开始。

Let's talk more about initiation and why it's important for the success of a project.

---

Because initiation is the first phase of the project, it's really important to get it right.

> 因为启动是项目的第一个阶段，所以把它做好是非常重要的。

A well-planned initiation results in a strong foundation for your project, and sets it up for success.

> 一个计划良好的启动会为您的项目奠定坚实的基础，并为成功奠定基础。

---

Initiation begins after a problem or opportunity has been identified within an organization.

> 在组织内部发现问题或机会后，启动就开始了。

---

Often, stakeholders like senior leaders at a company will initiate-发起 a project to address-设法解决 a specific need for the business.

> 通常，像公司高层领导这样的利益相关者会启动一个项目来解决业务的特定需求。

For example, perhaps-可能 the company would like to **roll out**-推出,展开 a new product, improve-改善,变得更好 employee **well being**-幸福感, or reduce costs in a certain-某些 department.

例如，也许公司想要推出一种新产品，提高员工的福利，或者降低某个部门的成本。

---

It's your responsibility as the project manager to help identify the project goals, resources, and other details based on initial discussions with the project stakeholders.

Even though someone else might **come up**-提出 with an idea for the project, it's still your job to **figure out**-弄清楚,理解 all the important pieces that need to come together **in order to**-为了 get the work done.

> 即使其他人可能会为项目提出一个想法，你的工作仍然是找出所有需要整合在一起以完成工作的重要部分。

---

The initiation phase is a crucial-至关重要的,决定性的 time for asking stakeholders the right questions, performing research-进行研究, determining resources, and clearly documenting the key components of a project.

> 启动阶段是向利益相关者提出正确问题、进行研究、确定资源和清楚地记录项目关键组成部分的关键时期。

Doing this will help you solidify-巩固 the scope, or the boundary-界限,范围, of the project.

> 这样做可以帮助你巩固项目的范围或边界。

If this seems a bit overwhelming-使受不了,令人不知所措的, don't worry.

> 如果这看起来有点难以应付，不要担心。

We'll talk more about project scope later on in this course.

If the project isn't initiated properly, things can go wrong pretty-相当 fast.

> 如果项目没有正确启动，事情可能很快就会出错。

For example, without sufficient-充足的 understanding of the project's goals, you might underestimate-低估 what resources you need or how long the project might take.

> 例如，如果没有对项目目标的充分理解，您可能会低估您需要的资源或项目可能花费的时间。

Or, without agreeing with stakeholders on what success looks like, you might think the project was completed successfully, while the stakeholders might think it didn't accomplish their goals.

Getting on the same page and gaining clarity during the initiation phase can save-节省 a lot of time and extra-额外的 work for everyone throughout the project.

> 在初始阶段达成一致并获得清晰度可以为整个项目中的每个人节省大量时间和额外的工作。

Proper-适当的 initiation also helps ensure that the benefits of the project outcomes will outweigh-超过 the costs of the project.

> 适当的启动还有助于确保项目成果的收益将超过项目的成本。

To determine this, you'll do what's called a cost benefit analysis, which is the process of adding up the expected-预料的 value of a project (the benefits) and comparing them to the dollar costs.

> 为了确定这一点，您将进行所谓的成本效益分析，这是将项目的预期价值(收益)加起来并将其与美元成本进行比较的过程。

To do this, you will work with stakeholders to consider a few questions.

To determine the benefits of a project, those questions might include: 

What value will this project create?

How much money could this project save our organization?

How much money will it bring in from existing customers?

How much time will be saved?

How will the user experience be improved?



And to determine the costs of the project, those questions might include:

How much time will people have to spend on this project?

What will be the one-time costs?

> 一次性费用是多少?

Are there any ongoing costs?

> 是否有任何持续的成本?

What about long-term costs?

> 那么长期成本呢?

The benefits of a project should always outweigh the costs, so it's really important that you consider these questions early on. 

Coming up, we'll talk more about the initiation phase and explore the key components of initiating a project.

Bye for now!

## Key components of project initiation	4 min

> 项目启动关键组件

Hello and welcome back.

You just learned about the initiation phase of the project life cycle and why it's so important to get it right.

Next, I'll teach you about the key components that **make up**-组成 initiation, and how these pieces **lead to**-导致 the planning phase of a project.

---

There are several-几个 key components of initiation that you need to consider in order for your project to be successful: goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders and resources. 

First you need to consider the goals of the project, the goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve.

All projects should have clear goals and often those will be determined by senior company leaders, with your help.

---

From there, you will begin to consider the project scope.

This is the process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project.

---

You also need to think about project deliverables.

They're the products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor-主办者.

Deliverables can be anything from product features and functionalities to documentation, processes and more, anything that enables-使能够 the goal of your project to be achieved.

Deliverables are submitted to help you reach-影响,达到 your project goals.

Also, it's important to keep in mind that the deliverables can be tangible-切实的 or intangible-无形的.

An example of a tangible deliverable might be submitting a chapter of a manuscript-手稿.

If the goal is to publish a textbook.

Or if your project goal is to finish implementation of a new point of sale software at a retail store, scheduling staff-职员的 training sessions could be an intangible deliverable.

---

Once the goals, scope and deliverables are determined, you need to consider success criteria.

Success criteria are the standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching its goals.

---

Another important consideration is your stakeholders.

Stakeholders are key to making informed decisions at every step of the project, including the initiation phase.

They're the people who both have an interest in and are affected by the completion and success of a project.

As a result, they're often instrumental-起作用的 in determining the goals, objectives, deliverables and success criteria of the project, from coming up with the idea to outlining-概括 the expectations-期待,预期 of its results.

> 因此，他们经常在确定项目的目标、目的、可交付成果和成功标准方面发挥重要作用，从提出想法到概述对结果的期望。

As you move through the initiation phase, it's your job to ensure that you understand the needs of the project stakeholders early on.

> 当您进入启动阶段时，您的工作是确保您尽早了解项目利益相关者的需求。

It's also your role to ensure that all stakeholders are in agreement on the goals and overall-总的,全面的 mission-任务,职责,天职 of the project before moving on to the next phase.

> 在进入下一阶段之前，确保所有利益相关者对项目的目标和总体任务达成一致也是您的职责。

---

Now, let's talk about resources, resources generally refer to the budget, people, materials, and other items-项目 that you will have at your disposal-安排.

> 现在，我们来谈谈资源，资源通常指的是预算、人员、材料和其他可供你支配的项目。

It's super important to think carefully about these pieces early on.

> 在早期仔细考虑这些部分是非常重要的。

No one wants to get started on a project, only to realize-了解,意识到 halfway-在中途 through that they don't have enough money or enough people to complete the work.

> 没有人想要开始一个项目，只在中途意识到他们没有足够的资金或足够的人来完成这项工作。

That would be a mess-杂乱,困境.

> 那将是一团糟。

---

Finally, once you've established-确定,建立,设立 your goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources, it's time to create a project charter-章程.

> 最后，一旦您确定了目标、范围、可交付成果、成功标准、涉众和资源，就该创建项目章程了。

A project charter is a document that contains all the details of the project.

Project charters clearly define the project and its goals and outline-概述 what is needed to accomplish them.

> 项目章程清楚地定义了项目及其目标，并概述了完成这些目标所需的条件。

A project charter allows you to get organized-组织, set up a framework for what needs to be done and communicate those details to others.

> 项目章程允许您组织起来，为需要完成的工作建立一个框架，并将这些细节与他人沟通。

Once you've drafted-起草,草拟 the charter, you would then review the document with key stakeholders to get their approval to move into the planning stage.

Coming up, you learn more about project charters and even get the chance to create one yourself.

> 接下来，你会学到更多关于项目章程的知识，甚至有机会自己创建一个。

Hopefully you're starting to see how the key components of initiation help lay the foundation of a solid-牢固的 project.

> 希望你已经开始明白开始的关键组成部分是如何为一个坚实的项目奠定基础的。

---

To quickly recap, you gather information about your goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources, and you document that information in the project charter.

> 为了快速概括，您收集有关目标、范围、可交付成果、成功标准、涉众和资源的信息，并将这些信息记录在项目章程中。

During the rest of this course, we'll talk more about each of the components outlined-概述 so far.

> 在本课程的其余部分中，我们将更多地讨论到目前为止概述的每个组件。

You've come so far and learned so much, keep up the great work.

> 你已经走了这么远，学到了这么多，继续努力吧。

They had not discussed the topic with any of my team members or myself, and they were **day minus one**-第一天 from launching the feature.

> 他们没有和我的任何团队成员或我自己讨论过这个话题，而且他们是在发布这个功能的第一天。

It was a total miss.

> 这完全是失误。

It really illustrates-说明,阐明 the point about when you initiate a project, you can't invest-投资,投入 enough time in meeting with stakeholders, meeting with your colleagues-同事,同僚, listening to them—actively listening.

> 这确实说明了当你启动一个项目时，你不能投入足够的时间与利益相关者会面，与你的同事会面，倾听他们的意见——积极地倾听。

Someone taught me recently-最近,不久前 the value of building that "listening to learn" muscle-肌肉.

> 最近有人教会了我建立“倾听学习”肌肉的价值。

And in the project initiation phase, to me, that is such a valuable-宝贵的 talent-天赋,才能, there are those that have it, there are those that have learned it, and there those who will never do it.

> 在项目启动阶段，对我来说，这是一种非常宝贵的才能，有些人拥有它，有些人学会了它，有些人永远不会这样做。

And I believe it's a trainable-可训练的 skill, but it requires you to really slow down and look at the landscape-风景,形势,情形 in front of you.

> 我相信这是一种可以训练的技能，但它需要你真的慢下来，看看你面前的风景。



## Performing-执行,履行 a cost-benefit analysis

> 执行成本效益分析

Previously, you learned that a **cost-benefit analysis** is the process of adding up the expected-期待,预计 value of a project—the benefits—and comparing them to the dollar costs.

> 前面，您了解到成本-收益分析是将项目的预期价值(收益)加起来并将其与美元成本进行比较的过程。

In this reading, we will discuss the benefits of conducting-实施,进行,指挥 a cost-benefit analysis, guiding questions to help you and your stakeholders conduct one, and how to calculate **return on investment (ROI)**-投资回报.

> 在这篇阅读中，我们将讨论进行成本效益分析的好处，指导问题以帮助您和您的利益相关者进行成本效益分析，以及如何计算投资回报率(ROI)。

**The benefits-好处 of a cost-benefit analysis**

> 成本效益分析的好处

A cost-benefit analysis can minimize-使最小化 risks and maximize-使最大化 gains-收益 for projects and organizations.

> 成本效益分析可以使项目和组织的风险最小化，收益最大化。

It can help you communicate clearly with stakeholders and executives-主管,经理 and keep your project **on track**-按计划进行.

> 它可以帮助您与利益相关者和执行人员进行清晰的沟通，并使您的项目保持正轨。

Because this type of analysis uses objective-客观的,目的,目标 data, it can help reduce biases-偏见,成见 and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing-影响,作用 decisions. 

> 因为这种类型的分析使用客观数据，它可以帮助减少偏见，并使利益相关者的自身利益不影响决策。

---

Comparing a project’s benefits to its costs can help you make a strong business case to stakeholders and leadership and ensure your organization pursues-追求 the most profitable-盈利的 or useful projects.

> 比较一个项目的收益和成本可以帮助你向利益相关者和领导提出一个强有力的商业案例，并确保你的组织追求最有利可图或最有用的项目。

Organizations use cost-benefit analysis to reduce waste and invest-投资,投入 their resources responsibly.

> 组织使用成本效益分析来减少浪费和负责任地投资资源。

**Guiding questions for a cost-benefit analysis**

> 成本效益分析的指导性问题

When you’re pursuing-追求,执行 a project, the benefits should outweigh-超过 the costs.

> 当你在进行一个项目时，收益应该大于成本。

It’s important for you and your stakeholders to consider questions like the ones that follow early on, while you prepare the proposal.

> 当你准备提案的时候，你和你的利益相关者考虑这些问题是很重要的。

To determine-确定,决定 the benefits of a project, you might ask:

> 要确定一个项目的好处，你可能会问:

- What value will this project create? 

- How much money could this project save-节省 our organization? 

	> 这个项目能为我们公司节省多少钱?

- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?

- How much time will it save? 

	> 它能节省多少时间?

- How will it improve the customer experience?

And to determine the costs of a project, consider questions such as:

- How much time will people have to spend on this project?

- What are the one-time costs?

	> 一次性费用是多少?

- Are there any ongoing costs?

	> 是否有任何持续的成本?

- What about long-term costs? 

	> 那么长期成本呢?

You might also consider questions about **intangible-不可捉摸的,难以确定的 benefits**.

> 你可能还会考虑有关“无形利益”的问题。

These are gains-收益 that are not quantifiable-可以计量的, such as:

> 这些是无法量化的收益，例如:

- **Customer satisfaction-满意**. Will the project increase customer retention-保持,保留, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 

	> 客户满意度。该项目是否会增加客户留存率，使他们在公司的产品或服务上花费更多?

- **Employee satisfaction**. Is the project likely to improve employee morale-士气,精神面貌, reducing-减少,降低 turnover-人员流动率? 

	> 员工满意。这个项目是否有可能提高员工士气，减少人员流动率?

- **Employee productivity-生产力**. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?

	> 员工生产力。项目是否会减少员工的加班时间，为公司节省资金?

- **Brand perception**. Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception-看法,认识 and recognition-识别, attracting-吸引 more customers or providing a competitive-竞争的 advantage-有利条件,优势?

	> 品牌认知。项目是否有可能提高公司的品牌认知和认知度，吸引更多的客户或提供竞争优势?

You can also flip-快速翻转 these questions to consider **intangible** ***costs***.

> 你也可以把这些问题反过来考虑无形成本。

These are costs that are not quantifiable.

> 这些成本是无法量化的。

For example, might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

> 例如，项目是否会将客户保留、员工满意度或品牌认知置于风险之中?

---

When assigning values to tangible-明确的 or intangible costs and benefits, you can reference-参考 similar past projects, conduct-实施,进行 industry-行业,产业 research, or consult-咨询,请教 with experts.

> 在为有形或无形的成本和收益赋值时，您可以参考类似的过去项目，进行行业研究或咨询专家。

**Calculating costs and benefits**

> 计算成本和收益

The process of calculating costs and benefits is also called calculating **return on investment**, or **ROI**.

> 计算成本和收益的过程也称为计算投资回报率(ROI)。

There are many ways to determine a project’s ROI, but the easiest way is to compare the upfront-预付的,预交的 and ongoing costs to its benefits over time.

> 有许多方法可以确定项目的ROI，但最简单的方法是将前期和持续的成本与长期收益进行比较。

One common ROI formula-公式,方程式 is:

![img](img/2.png)

In this formula, **G** represents-代表 the financial-财政的 gains-收益 you expect-期待,预计 from the project, and **C** represents the upfront and ongoing costs of your investment-投资 in the project.

> 在这个公式中，**G**代表项目的财务收益，**C**代表你在项目中投资的前期和持续成本。

---

For example, imagine your project costs $6,000 up front plus $25 per month for 12 months.

This equals $300 per year, but you estimate that the project will bring in $10,000 in revenue-收入,收益 over the course of that year.

> 这相当于每年300美元，但你估计这个项目将在那一年带来1万美元的收入。

Using the formula above, you calculate the ROI as: ($10,000 - $6,300) ÷ $6,300 = 0.58 = 58%

---

The ROI comes to 0.58, or 58%. 

You consider this to be a strong ROI, so you decide to pursue-执行,追求,致力于 the project.

> 您认为这是一个强大的ROI，因此您决定继续这个项目。

**Key takeaway**

> 关键要点

Performing a cost-benefit analysis can help you and your stakeholders determine if it **makes sense to**-对......有意义 **take on**-承担 a new project by evaluating-评估 if its benefits outweigh its costs.

> 执行成本-收益分析可以帮助您和您的利益相关者通过评估收益是否大于成本来确定是否有意义接受一个新项目。

When conducting-实施,进行 cost-benefit analyses for your prospective-潜在的,预期的 projects, you can use the guiding questions and ROI formula provided in this reading as a reference. 

> 在为您的预期项目进行成本效益分析时，您可以使用本阅读中提供的指导性问题和ROI公式作为参考。

Hopefully, you're starting to see how important this phase is for the overall health of a project.

> 希望您开始看到这个阶段对于项目的整体健康是多么重要。

As we talked about earlier, a lack-缺乏,不足 of preparation during the initiation stage can lead to problems later on in the project life cycle, like a budget shortage-短缺,不足, a missed deadline, or too few teammates to complete the work.

> 正如我们前面所讨论的，在初始阶段缺乏准备可能会导致项目生命周期后期的问题，如预算短缺、错过最后期限或团队成员太少而无法完成工作。

But with early planning, you can set your team up for success.

> 但有了早期的计划，你可以让你的团队走向成功。

We also introduced you to the major factors you should consider during the initiation phase, including goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders and resources.

All of these come together in the early plans for a project and are documented in a project charter-章程.

> 所有这些都汇集在项目的早期计划中，并记录在项目章程中。

Now that you understand the basic elements of initiation, let's dive-潜水 deeper-更深.

> 既然你已经了解了启动的基本要素，让我们再深入一点。

Next up, we'll talk about identifying goals and deliverables and learn more about measurement and success criteria.

> 接下来，我们将讨论确定目标和可交付成果，并了解更多关于度量和成功标准的信息。

You're doing great, and we'll see you soon.
